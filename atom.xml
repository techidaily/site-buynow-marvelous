channel</li><li>No USB ports</li></ul><p> TP-Link has built a reputation for itself recently with some surprisingly affordable Wi-Fi 6 routers, and the Deco X20 is no exception. This small but mighty mesh system represents a way to get into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without emptying your wallet.</p><p> The X20 is a good choice for users who need broad coverage, with three units handling homes of up to 5,800 square feet. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 support offers a comfortable 1.8Mbps bandwidth, although this is only partially on par with some of the pricier alternatives in this list.</p><p> But more importantly, the Deco X20 lacks the dedicated backhaul channel on more advanced mesh Wi-Fi systems. This means it may not perform as well on busy and heavily congested home networks — those with a dozen or more devices gaming, video calling, and streaming in 4K—but it should be more than enough for the online needs of smaller families.</p><p> The Deco X20 is a breeze to set up, thanks to TP-Link’s aptly named Deco app, which can help even the most inexperienced home networking users get up and running within a few minutes. It also includes TP-Link’s new HomeCare security suite, powered by Trend Micro. It offers anti-malware features and parental controls to keep your home network safe against intruders and kids away from the internet’s darker corners. Each unit includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect non-wireless devices, but sadly, there aren’t any USB ports for sharing external storage devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> HomeCare, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX1800 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><h2 id="Best-Parental-Controls"><a href="#Best-Parental-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Best Parental Controls"></a>Best Parental Controls</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >Netgear Orbi Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e0pqAK3I9BIPd_HjQl8z5DRaZ-I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-orbi-whole-home-wi-fi-system-41457ad2356b431eb21ef92d6fc06f7e.jpg" >Netgear Orbi Whole Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >$225 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast and reliable coverage</li><li>Easy to set up</li><li>Highly configurable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>USB ports don’t support shared storage</li></ul><p> Netgear’s Orbi strikes an almost perfect balance of performance, price, and features among mesh Wi-Fi systems. With only two units, Orbi can provide fast and stable Wi-Fi over an area of up to 5,000 square feet, and this range can be easily extended by adding additional units.</p><p> Netgear promises that Orbi can deliver at least 150Mbps anywhere in your home, which was more than evident in our testing. You’ll enjoy smooth online performance throughout your living space without worrying about buffering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830" >Netflix 4K UHD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> streams or stuttering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476" >Zoom calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Orbi accomplishes this by dedicating the fastest of its three Wi-Fi bands as a backhaul channel. Remember that in a mesh network, data to or from your device may pass from one access point to the following multiple times before it reaches your router and moves on to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924" >Internet Service Provider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network. The backhaul channel provides dedicated bandwidth for this pass-through traffic, ensuring you’ll get the same excellent wireless performance whether your devices are closer to the central unit or one of the satellite units.</p><p> This also makes the collection of four Gigabit Ethernet ports found on each unit even more helpful, as you can plug in things like a TV and not see a drop in speed. Each also has a USB 2.0 port for sharing printers around your home.

The MX 12600 bundle includes three identical Wi-Fi 6 capable AX4200 mesh units (three times 4,200 is 12,600, see?) for less than most other systems charge for only two. This means solid and reliable performance for homes of up to 8,100 square feet at an affordable price.</p><p> You’ll designate one of these units as the primary router that hosts your broadband connection, then place the other two wherever you need the best and strongest coverage in your home. The Velop system also features a “dynamic” backhaul channel: The system intelligently decides which of the three Wi-Fi bands is best suited to move traffic between the mesh stations and which should be available for your Wi-Fi clients.</p><p> Each unit also includes four Gigabit Ethernet ports, letting you hardwire in non-Wi-Fi devices. And thanks to a high-speed USB 3.2 port on the back of each unit, you can connect multiple hard drives or other storage devices for sharing files or even streaming media.</p><p> Linksys’ mobile app also makes the system a cinch to set up, walking you through getting the first unit online and then joining the other two into a single mesh network. Although you’ll need to use the mobile app for the initial configuration, you can manage the system from the more familiar web interface once the mesh has been configured.</p><p> The MX12600 system offers all the basic networking features you’d expect from a modern router, including elementary Quality of Service (QoS) support (which prioritizes devices based on the type of service they’re using.

Since a two-unit system will give you 5,000 square feet of Wi-Fi coverage (which can be expanded by adding up to five more satellite units), you’ll be sure to see consistently fast speeds anywhere in your home.</p><p> Netgear has also packed in four Gigabit Ethernet ports on each station, so you’ll have plenty of room for wiring in devices like game consoles for maximum performance. The main router on this higher-end model also offers a high-speed 2.5Gbps<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383" >Wide Area Network (WAN) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port to ensure you’re ready for the fastest home broadband connections.</p><p> One disappointing aspect of Netgear’s newer Wi-Fi 6 solution is the omission of the USB ports found in earlier Orbi versions. The lack of advanced configuration settings may also let power users down compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers. But if you want to maintain the best performance possible, even if it means sacrificing some network management features, this is the mesh system for you.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX6000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cjLjOjMRWQJm5An87vAXSv1ZALw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearOrbiAX6000-01f5a284913b44099978b706c3a3fa79.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi AX6000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/orbi-whole-home-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-review-5069596" >Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u36wLJKd2jTPAgvkVuGxo2A8P4g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-zenwifi-xt8-ax6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-3865cd2d845349a78c533b0b397df43b.jpg" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 AX6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >$282 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/447452455" >$282 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1541979-REG/asus%5Fxt8%5Fb%5F2%5Fpk%5Fzenwifi%5Fac%5Fwhole%5Fhome%5Ftri%5Fband.html" >$350 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of advanced features</li><li>Parental and security controls</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul><p> Although Asus’ AiMesh technology will let you join almost any combination of Asus routers to form a mesh network, the company’s ZenWiFi XT8 takes that further. It’s a “mesh-first” system that works right out of the box to give you maximum coverage and performance throughout your home with minimum fuss. The Asus mobile app makes it so easy to set up you won’t even notice how much power it packs under the hood.</p><p> The ZenWifi XT8 offers cutting-edge 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 technology and packs many gaming enhancements that have become synonymous with Asus routers.

Even better, Asus’ AiMesh technology means you can easily add other Asus router models or the ZenWiFi system to your existing wired Asus router.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> AiProtection, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OVHAXIS6oyYG_3zI0cikh72G8ig=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ASUSZenWiFiAX6600-8dda0992ebd2432086abe152da110106.jpg"                      alt="ASUS ZenWiFi AX6600"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Smart-Homes"><a href="#Best-for-Smart-Homes" class="headerlink" title="Best for Smart Homes"></a>Best for Smart Homes</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB" >Google Nest Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/CV5RgmojhaK6mnzCK8c_kcfs6Jc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/google-nest-wi-fi-2nd-generation-a94c4c7e3d0c47a9afd3d8964caf86d8.jpg" >Google Nest Wi-Fi (2nd Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07YMJ57MB" >$89 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/575491453" >$110 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Google-Nest-Wifi-Router-and-Add-on-Point-Snow-GA00822-US/311324762" >$281 at Home Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Attractive and simple design</li><li>Integrates with Google Home</li><li>Point units double as smart speakers</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No Ethernet ports on points</li><li>Lacks a dedicated backhaul channel</li></ul><p> Google’s Nest Wi-Fi is a straightforward mesh system that provides excellent integration features for users of Google Assistant and Google-compatible smart home devices. The second generation of Google’s mesh solution, Nest Wi-Fi’s satellite units (called “point” units) double as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smart speakers. So, it’s an especially great choice for anyone already invested in the Google ecosystem. You can issue voice commands to control smart appliances, check the weather, send messages, and set up calendar appointments.</p><p> Three units—the central base station and two points—provide up to 5,400 square feet of coverage. Google’s Home and Wi-Fi apps make this an absolute cinch to set up and manage. It even lets you set up a guest network for your friends and other visitors and let them get online simply by<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >scanning a QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The main downside to Nest Wi-Fi is that the base station includes only one Ethernet LAN port, and you won’t find any at all on the satellite points, so you’ll need to add your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ethernet-and-network-hubs-816358" >network hub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to hardwire in some of your devices at the router. And if you need to wire in devices at the points, you’ll want to look elsewhere.</p><p> Additionally, the Nest doesn’t support the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard like some of the other systems here, so if you need maximum performance or are a stickler for future-proofing your network, the Nest may not be the best option.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC2200 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O_4HqL-cj7KOoa_JTrVN--P752o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleNestWi-Fi-9704c0e2a822442d89253e49f44d9948.jpg"                      alt="Google Nest Wi-Fi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-nest-wi-fi-review-4846243" >Google Nest Wi-Fi Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >Linksys Velop AC6600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/j4p01isOS24wSYnZhkkDN75cgIU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ac6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-system-c5531ec228e247eb88bb7d05247c3842.jpg" >Linksys Velop AC6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >$170 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/55384671" >$170 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcrichard.com/linksys-velop-whole-home-mesh-wi-fi-system-3-pack/WHW0303.html?slpfid=3" >View on Pcrichard.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Strong, consistent connection</li><li>Sleek Design</li><li>Great range</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some basic settings</li><li>Some features cost extra</li></ul><p> Linksys’ first whole home Wi-Fi system, the Velop Tri-Band AC6600, is one of the more attractive designs we’ve seen. Each sleek white node is roughly the size of a tower of Jenga blocks, and they look nice enough to sit on display rather than being hidden away. Linksys sells Velop nodes individually or in packs of two or three; each will give you about 2,000 square feet of coverage. So, a complete system can blanket a 6,000-square-foot home.</p><p> The Velop AC6600 system includes tri-band Wi-Fi and dedicates the second 5GHz band as a backhaul channel. This means it can keep traffic moving smoothly between all units for maximum performance throughout your home, even if one is under heavy usage. The downside is that your devices won’t be able to take advantage of the extra 5GHz band, so even though each of these AC2200 routers can theoretically provide 2,134Mbps of throughput, only 1,267Mbps of that total is available to your devices.</p><p> The Velop offers a simplified setup process thanks to the Linksys smartphone app. However, if you like to tinker with your network settings, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere since it has limited configuration options. There’s also no malware protection, and parental controls are confined to blocking websites and manually restricting internet access from specific devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SkmNvOHzz4u2QHpClMEbMhzcBbQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LinksysVelopAC6600-2fd0f211926949cd9e38646f533fb981-6b8bc5f3009346dfaee7ef6b86357f34.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop AC6600"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/linksys-velop-review-powerful-mesh-router-5072402" >Linksys Velop Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network"></a>What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network</h2><p> Every wireless router, no matter how many antennas it has or how powerful it is, suffers from the same issue: radio signals weaken when they pass through walls, floors, and other obstructions. Mesh Wi-Fi network systems are designed to solve this problem by placing a number of nodes throughout your home or business, creating a uniformly strong signal with no dead spots.</p><p> Unlike traditional routers with wireless extenders and access points, mesh systems are designed from the ground up to work as a node-based system. Setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network system is typically a lot easier than connecting range extenders to an existing system, and they automatically pass your connection from one node to the next as you move around your home.</p><p> The main drawback of mesh Wi-Fi network systems is the price, as they tend to be more expensive than traditional routers. You can typically buy a nice router and some extenders for less than a mesh Wi-Fi starter kit, but if your situation really calls for a mesh system, it’s well worth the additional investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFk9VbnycX8txbFO35hsBW2ZGvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-2_1-5c8fbca346e0fb000172f07e.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire</p><h3 id="Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use"><a href="#Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?"></a>Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?</h3><p> Most mesh Wi-Fi network systems support a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-connected-home-817684" >smart home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> integration system, and a few support more than one.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the most commonly supported, with integration from manufacturers like Eero, Linksys, Netgear, and more. Philips Hue,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ifttt-4172417" >IFTTT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and others see less integration.</p><p> If you already have some smart devices in your home, and you’re already tied into either the Alexa or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-home-and-how-does-it-work-4801919" >Google Home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ecosystem, then that should inform your decision regarding which mesh Wi-Fi network system to choose, but keep in mind that you don’t technically need your router to support your smart home assistant unless you need to be able to control its features with voice commands, such as enabling your guest network or blocking access to your kids’ devices.</p><p> If you’re an Apple HomeKit user, then the iPhone maker has taken a different approach. You won’t find any routers that can be controlled via Siri, however, a few mesh systems are adding HomeKit-specific security features to keep your smart home devices protected from network intrusions, which is something that neither Google Home nor Amazon Alexa yet offers.</p><h3 id="Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs"><a href="#Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs"></a>Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs</h3><p> Since mesh systems are high-end equipment, they typically include robust security options and parental controls. There are a handful of systems that don’t include either, so look for those if you don’t have kids and prefer to manage security on individual devices.</p><p> The most important thing to check in this area is whether or not the security and parental controls of the mesh system you’re interested in require a subscription. Basic security options are often free, but the best-advanced protections and parental controls often come at the cost of an ongoing monthly subscription, so make sure to take that into account.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi extender?<br> Mesh Wi-Fi systems and Wi-Fi extenders extend the reach of your wireless signal beyond your main router’s range. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are more tightly integrated, with the main and satellite devices expressly designed to work in concert.</li><li>Are mesh Wi-Fi systems faster?<br> Technically speaking, a mesh Wi-Fi system won’t offer better performance than an equivalent standalone router when you’re sitting right beside it. Since speed always falls off due to a weaker signal as you move farther away from your router, mesh systems can make a difference in larger homes.</li><li>Do you need to replace your existing router?<br> In most cases, the answer is yes. Although some mesh Wi-Fi systems can work with existing routers, you’ll generally get better performance and a much better user experience if you use a full mesh Wi-Fi system. If you’re a cable internet subscriber, you’ll still need to hang onto your cable modem.</li><li>How fast is a mesh Wi-Fi system?<br> Since mesh Wi-Fi network systems are uniformly high-end, they are also pretty fast. If your home internet connection isn’t very fast, then there isn’t any benefit to choosing a speedier mesh system over a slower one. You can check your internet connection speed with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-test-sites-2626177" >free speed tests <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you aren’t sure what it is.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/mlb-the-show-nineteen-baseball-excellence-meets-unexpected-adventure-game-twists-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>'MLB The Show Nineteen': Baseball Excellence Meets Unexpected Adventure Game Twists - A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-convert-vimeo-hd-mp4-format-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Convert Vimeo HD  MP4 Format Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-ace-ios-selection-of-best-psp-emulators/"><u>[New] Ace iOS Selection of Best PSP Emulators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-explore-template-treasures-to-craft-unique-corporate-emblems/"><u>[New] Explore Template Treasures to Craft Unique Corporate Emblems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-innovate-your-online-identity-with-these-30-exceptional-tiktok-names/"><u>[New] In 2024, Innovate Your Online Identity with These 30 Exceptional TikTok Names</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-camera-shake-in-photographyvideo-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>[Updated] Camera Shake In Photography/Video | What You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-podcast-style-unboxing/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Podcast-Style Unboxing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-seamless-speed-control-the-editors-essential-handbook/"><u>2024 Approved  Seamless Speed Control  The Editor's Essential Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tactics-to-maximize-engagement-with-every-reddit-post/"><u>2024 Approved  Tactics to Maximize Engagement with Every Reddit Post</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-closer-look-at-razers-portable-solution-for-gamers-enhanced-wi-fi-connectivity-unveiled/"><u>A Closer Look at Razer’s Portable Solution for Gamers - Enhanced Wi-Fi Connectivity Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/apex-choice-of-keyboard-palm-rest-mats-ergonomic-selections-for-the-year-2024/"><u>Apex Choice of Keyboard Palm Rest Mats: Ergonomic Selections for the Year 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-and-its-monumental-journey-through-medieval-lore-a-game-review/"><u>Assassin's Creed: Valhalla and Its Monumental Journey Through Medieval Lore – A Game Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/asus-bw-16d1c-u-blu-ray-drive-insight-a-combination-of-style-and-quirkiness-explored/"><u>Asus BW-16D1C-U Blu-Ray Drive Insight: A Combination of Style and Quirkiness Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/audio-arena-airpods-pro-vs-samsungs-pod-tastic-buds-pro/"><u>Audio Arena: AirPods Pro vs Samsung's Pod-Tastic Buds Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/boost-ps3-storage-replace-original-hard-drive/"><u>Boost PS3 Storage - Replace Original Hard Drive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/breaking-down-the-cost-vs-comfort-the-ultimate-review-of-mophies-powerstation-ac-charger/"><u>Breaking Down the Cost Vs.

As beautiful as it is on the outside, under the hood you also have a solid set of components with a 3.4GHz 7th generation quad-core Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 1TB Fusion Drive. Apple has managed to pack quite a bit of power inside the slender frame. We put it to the test to see how it fares for multimedia and productivity uses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TCcSm-nkER9HhHM8YIPMWbaezRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-4-fa6cf253bfd44ab991c366691b68bdf5.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements"><a href="#Design-Beautiful-with-room-for-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements"></a><strong>Design: Beautiful, with room for improvements</strong></h2><p> It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >beautiful machine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from top to bottom. Before even turning it on, the design of the computer a striking, aluminum-clad body that’s still subtle enough that it will blend in with nearly any office or home environment.</p><p> The tapered design makes the edges appear almost non-existent while its bulkier behind manages to round things out in a proportional manner. At its thinnest point — the edges — the iMac measures in at just 0.2 inches. On its integrated stand, the iMac measures in at 17.7 inches tall, 20.8 inches wide, and 6.9 inches deep. Amazingly, all of that weighs in at just 12.5 pounds, not including the keyboard and mouse.</p><p> Overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package.</p><p> Aside from the Apple logo on the front aluminum chin of the iMac, all of the connections and ports on the iMac are on the rear of the computer. This includes, left to right: a 3.5mm headphone jack, SD card slot, four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 3.0 ports (USB-C), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and power adapter. There’s also a Kensington lock slot to let you secure the the iMac.</p><p> We would’ve liked to see a thinner bezel around the screen, as the one present on the iMac is about half an inch — much larger than even the most basic PC monitors. It’d be a bit different if Apple were doing more with that real estate, but as it stands, it feels like wasted space</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gM_JxuZjDbSUs7DYtXIwUIqqz0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-3-d30c5f8414e94cbd9b1ec8aea9b18950.jpg"                      alt="Apple iMac 21.5-inch 4K"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-One-plug-and-you’re-good-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go"></a><strong>Setup Process: One plug and you’re good to go</strong></h2><p> One of Apple’s core tenets is simplicity, and the 4K iMac is no exception to this rule. Inside the box is the computer itself and a box which contains the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. Additional components include the power connection for the computer, a Lightning cable for charging the mouse and keyboard, and a small package of documentation.</p><p> Setting up the iMac is as simple as unwrapping it from its protective cover, setting it on the desk, plugging it in with the included power cord, and pressing the power button. As it boots up, we turned on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. By the time the iMac was to the setup screen — a process that took approximately 60 seconds — the two were already paired with the computer and ready to be used.</p><p> Going through the setup process took us approximately five minutes, which included setting up our iCloud account and getting the various login settings in place. We opted to set this up as a new computer, but there’s also the ability to set it up from an Apple Time Capsule backup or transfer content from a PC via USB. The amount of time those options take will vary depending on the device you’re transferring the information from as well as the amount of data being transferred.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine"><a href="#Display-Bright-brilliant-and-ready-to-shine" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine"></a><strong>Display: Bright, brilliant, and ready to shine</strong></h2><p> With a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels, the 4K iMac has more than 9.4 million pixels and features a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch, more than enough to make individual pixels indistinguishable at normal viewing distances.

Unlike a traditional hard drive (HDD), which relies exclusively on spinning platters to write and read information, Apple’s Fusion Drive also adds a small solid state storage (SSD) partition. This is where the operating system and most critical applications are stored, as solid state memory is much faster than traditional HDDs. The result is a drive that offers some of the advantages of SSDs while still offering the more affordable price tag and capacity of HDDs.</p><p> In our tests, boot-up time ranged from 15 seconds to 25 seconds. Considering the hybrid-style Fusion Drive, this lines up with our expectations, falling right between SSD speeds and HDD speeds. The same held true with boot-up times for various applications, ranging from Safari to more resource-intensive applications such as Final Cut Pro.</p><p> Moving onto the CPU and GPU benchmarks, we tested the iMac with both Geekbench and Cinebench to see how well the 3.4GHz quad-core processor and AMD Radeon Pro 560 held up.</p><p> “Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac.”</p><p> In the Geekbench tests, the iMac scored 4,866 on the single core test, 14,151 on the multi-core test, and 56,974 on the OpenCL score. This falls in line with other iMacs of the same specifications and hovers around other computers with similar specifications. In Cinebench, the iMac achieved 93.86 frames per second in the OpenGL test and a score of 584 cb in the CPU test.</p><p> All-in-all, the iMac seems to punch right at or above its specifications when compared to similar hardware. It’s not going to be pumping out 8K footage, but for basic 4K video editing and image post-processing, the graphics card is more than enough. As for productivity, there’s not much you can throw at the iMac that it can’t handle. The only thing we noticed slowing down the computer was the 8GB of RAM when we had over a dozen applications open, but that can be fixed by upgrading to the 16GB or 32GB model (although it’s not a cheap upgrade).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Fast-and-reliable"><a href="#Network-Fast-and-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Network: Fast and reliable"></a><strong>Network: Fast and reliable</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac features both wired and wireless connectivity for internet access. As previously mentioned, the iMac features a Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45) port on the rear of the computer for a hardwired internet connection. For Wi-Fi, the iMac uses an 802.11ac network adapter with support for IEEE 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n.</p><p> In our hardwired tests, the iMac maxed out our Gigabit fiber optic internet no problem, with steady download and upload speeds. Wireless connectivity was equally impressive, regardless of whether the iMac was in the same room as the router or a few rooms over. We didn’t notice any drops throughout our tests and both uploading and downloading content was consistent.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713565&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Mac： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks"><a href="#Camera-Decent-built-in-option-for-basic-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks"></a><strong>Camera: Decent built-in option for basic tasks</strong></h2><p> The only camera on the 4K iMac is the integrated webcam, which sits dead center above the display.

If you’re used to macOS as a whole, you’ll feel right at home as we did. Compared to past versions of macOS, Mojave improves in a number of areas, including an integrated Dark mode that turns much of the user interface dark grey to spare your eyes. There’s also a feature called “Stacks” that intelligently combines files of the same type on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Apple annually announces and subsequently releases a new operating system, free of charge, to install on Apple computers. In-between major releases Apple will also push out incremental updates, at least two of which we installed during our review process. These incremental installs can be done either manually within the System Preferences applications or be set to install themselves automatically when the computer is plugged in and powered on.</p><p> Unlike Windows, macOS doesn’t come with any bloatware either. There’s a number of pre-installed apps developed by Apple, including four new ones borrowed from Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, but most of the pre-installed apps are the standard array of programs you’d expect to see on any modern computer.</p><h2 id="Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real"><a href="#Price-The-Apple-tax-is-real" class="headerlink" title="Price: The Apple tax is real"></a><strong>Price: The Apple tax is real</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac we tested with the aforementioned specifications retails for $1,499. Compared to other Windows PCs with similar specifications, the iMac is without pricey for the specs it offers. However, this is par for the course with Apple, so much so that the term “Apple tax” has become a commonly-used phrase. What you’re paying for is the entire package, wrapped up in one of the best-looking frames out there.</p><p> Could you build a PC with better specs for far less money? Absolutely. But it won’t be running macOS and it certainly won’t be as slim and streamlined as the iMac. If you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem and don’t need to shell out for the more expensive 27-inch 5K iMac, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac is priced much more reasonably and still has plenty to offer.</p><h2 id="Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market"><a href="#Competition-A-unique-option-in-a-small-market" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A unique option in a small market"></a><strong>Competition: A unique option in a small market</strong></h2><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac has a few competitors in its specification range, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two: the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 700 and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/all-in-one-pcs/zen-aio/" >Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> All three all-in-one desktops feature 4K displays (or at least the option to order them with 4K displays). Aside from that, the specifications also line up similarly, with i7 CPU configurations, dedicated GPU options, SSD variations, and beefy memory choices.</p><p> Of course, the biggest difference between the three desktops is that the 21.5-inch 4K iMac runs macOS while the other two run Windows 10. Using Apple’s included Boot Camp program, it’s possible to run Windows 10 (and other operating systems) on the iMac, but macOS isn’t able to be run on the other devices.</p><p> Other differences include various connections options on the back of the computers and variations in size—most notably the iMac is quite a bit smaller in dimensions across the board. That said, the larger size allows easier access to internals which makes upgrading easier on the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 700 and Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC.</p><p> Prices vary greatly between the three desktops depending on the configuration you’re looking for, but overall, the 21.5-inch 4K iMac seems to hold its own in this price range, despite Apple’s notoriety for being a little bit on the pricier side.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Beautiful display in a thin, powerful machine.</strong></p><p> The 21.5-inch 4K iMac is a solid all-in-one computer that packs a lot of power into a tiny, well-designed package. It’s not going to blow anyone away on benchmarks and it’s not cheap for the internal components you’re getting, but it has a lot to offer for multimedia and productivity. That’s not to mention the sheer convenience of having everything simply work out of the box.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190"

Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1494880/17238" target="_top" id="1494880"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1494880"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1494880/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus is an interesting proposition. For only $50, it promises to provide heart rate monitoring, music storage, call management, voice control, and remote notifications. For the most part, it delivers. The Bitwatch has its share of design flaws, such as a poorly fitted watch strap and an iOS-only voice app, but it performs enough to be a reasonable consideration for those looking for their first smartwatch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8rMhc1Lk5yFRFW4Zlt2K9cmPdFo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-4-01d7e5ff51aa47008d803513064f4a7a.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch"><a href="#Design-and-Software-A-surprising-amount-of-features-in-this-chunky-watch" class="headerlink" title="Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch"></a><strong>Design and Software: A surprising amount of features in this chunky watch</strong></h2><p> The most outstanding feature of the Bitwatch’s design is its chunkiness. For those with small wrists, this smartwatch looks ridiculous. Furthermore, the included bands are too small in comparison to the watch, giving the overall design a cheap feel. When you wear this watch, you will notice it weighing your wrists down, taunting you to take it off. But as ugly as the Bitwatch is, it is a functional little watch. It has a power button and volume buttons, as well as a strong vibration motor. Its touchscreen works without a problem, and the app layout is intuitive to understand.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240). When you scroll through the Bitwatch’s apps, it’s apparent that it heavily favors Apple devices: there is a Siri app integration, but this will not work with Android devices. Its other apps are a phonebook, call log, dialer, messaging, remote notifier, “anti-theft” (Find My Phone), alarm, calendar, music storage and playback, remote capture, pedometer, sleep monitor, sedentary reminder, heart rate monitor, sound recorder, stopwatch, and calculator. It’s a fairly thorough collection of applications for a watch that doesn’t support third-party apps.</p><p> The 2-inch IPS panel is bright and easy to read, although not the highest resolution (240 x 240).</p><p> While it doesn’t have<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nfc-832715" >NFC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or GPS, it does have a speaker, and you can send basic messages with the watch. The Bitwatch S1 is surprisingly robust for those who want to dip their toes into the smartwatch experience, with many of the features that mid-tier smartwatches possess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-but-unexplained" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy, but unexplained</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Bitwatch works as you’d expect. Pair it via the Bluetooth on your phone and download the Beantech app. It works with both Android and iOS, so you should have no difficulty. Alerts will show up in the remote notifier app, and apps such as the calendar are not synced with your phone’s calendar apps, so keep that in mind if you’d like to add any events, notifications, or alarms to your watch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O7xHfA9sKsBdC0nmqNXbFky-Dm4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-2-3b838f1124184bbd9452b79bb8449c2b.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Performance-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Performance: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Performance: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch’s low price tag shows in its performance, unfortunately. The Siri app is just that: it interfaces with Siri, meaning that voice commands are iOS-exclusive. Notification handling on the device can get confusing also. You find notifications in the Remote Notifier app, and dismissing them on the Bitwatch does not dismiss them on your phone.</p><p> You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker.</p><p> However, notifications do sync almost instantly from your phone to the Bitwatch, and its heart rate monitor is fairly accurate when measuring a resting heart rate. The pedometer isn’t the best thought, often falling within a range of a hundred steps of the true value.</p><p> If you’d like to listen to calls or music through the speaker, you will miss a lot of information— think of those jingles they play when you’re on hold for a phone call. At least the screen is big and easy to read, and the notifications_do_ work. It’s good enough for someone that wants to get a feel to a smartwatch experience, but there are better options for a little more money if you can afford it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7GtX2IU-w4sJA-BTqQtHQThxaJo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4157747-3-ade31135cd9d4fe0b6b01286941d2652.jpg"                      alt="Beantech Bitwatch S1 Plus Smartwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19080710&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smart-seo-tool.com/images/SmartSEOAuditorBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches"><a href="#Battery-It-last-longer-than-most-flagship-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches"></a><strong>Battery: It last longer than most flagship smartwatches</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Bitwatch is excellent. With regular usage (GPS, heart rate, Bluetooth all on), we got between two and three days of use before we had to recharge. Charging is a little annoying, though, since it uses a snapping charger base that’s difficult to remove.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-but-worth-paying-more" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable, but worth paying more</strong></h2><p> The Bitwatch costs about $50, which is reasonable for its features and performance. You get reliable notifications and a passable heart rate monitor, as well as some basic functions like alarms and a speaker. If you want a cheap smartwatch, then the Bitwatch isn’t a bad pick, but $30 more can get you GPS and smarter notifications.

However, it suffers in reliability and style, which may turn users off from the smartwatch market altogether. For a little more money, you can get the Amazfit Bip_,_ a sleek smartwatch from Huami that has a thirty-day battery life, fitness tracking, onboard GPS, and notifications. If you’re looking to get something very cheap to try out the smartwatch lifestyle, you should also look at the Padgene DZ09 Smart Watch, which is only $15 and has a lot of the features on the Bitwatch.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazfit-bip-review-4773112" >Amazfit Bip Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ultra-budget smartwatch that covers the basics.</strong></p><p> The Beantech Bitwatch is not a groundbreaking smartwatch, but it provides a lot of essential features for $50.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Google has disrupted the old-guard tech world, from its software and services to the rise of Android in the mobile space—and it has done much the same in the laptop market with its Chromebook concept. Typically priced well below the competition while delivering strong core services and functionality, the Chrome OS-powered notebooks have become the affordable device of choice for many students, schools, and other budget-minded buyers.  </p><p> Launched in early 2017, the Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA) 12.5-inch laptop has been one of the most popular options, and more than two years later, it’s still on the market. Can this convertible laptop&#x2F;tablet hybrid really supplant ultraportable Windows and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Mac laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at a fraction of the price, or are the compromises too significant to overcome? We spent a week with the Chromebook Flip to see how it compares to today’s competition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3Q2pRvweVt3Gf6RfBaAwQ15QBag=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bottom_04-1508a99e93e94312a9477c6ec5c15022.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice"><a href="#Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice"></a><strong>Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice</strong></h2><p> Just as Chromebooks are conceptually designed as budget laptops, the Asus Chromebook Flip is physically built like a budget MacBook. It has the same kind of minimal aesthetic, albeit not to quite the same level of premium visual polish. From the hinge design to the materials and tiny nuances, the Chromebook Flip doesn’t look like a $1,000 laptop.</p><p> That’s not a complaint, just an observation. With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap. It feels like it’s built to deal with the daily stress of usage, but at a weight of just 2.65 pounds, it’s very light and easy to carry around. It does seem to attract dirt and smudges more than a lot of other aluminum laptops we’ve used, although it’s not difficult to rub them away.</p><p> The 12.5-inch touchscreen is a smidge smaller than the common 13-inch laptop screen size, but due to a lot of bezel around the display, the laptop’s overall size is nearly identical to an Apple MacBook Pro (albeit a little thicker). The excessive bezel and large Asus logo do signal the less high-end experience, however.</p><p> With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap.</p><p> Of course, as the name suggests, the Chromebook Flip does something that no MacBook can: it’s convertible, allowing you to fold the screen all the way back into a tablet form, or use a tent-like design to prop the device up and watch videos. The hinge feels sturdy in any position, thankfully, so you don’t have to worry about the tent falling flat, or the screen flopping around in any mode.</p><p> We’ve been using the Chromebook Flip in the tent mode to watch Twitch streams or YouTube playlists while washing dishes or making dinner, or having it run in the corner of a desk while doing other work. It’s super handy to have around as a portable, self-standing streaming display. And in the tablet format, with the screen fully folded back, it’s totally useful. It feels a bit odd to press your fingers against the keys while holding it, but don’t worry: they’re disabled in that form.</p><p> Like current MacBooks, the Chromebook Flip is all about USB-C ports; it puts one on each side and skips full-sized USB-A ports entirely. You can charge the laptop from either of those ports, and that versatility is appreciated. However, there’s also a microSD card port on the right, which is handy as the 64GB internal storage on this model is pretty slim (there are 32GB and 128GB versions available, as well), along with a 3.5mm headphone port on the left side.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip’s keyboard feels great in action. The one-piece chiclet keyboard has a scissor-style key design with 1.4mm of travel, which gives it a more satisfying feel than the latest MacBooks’ keys (which have very little travel), and the keys are responsive and not especially loud in usage. It’s also brightly backlit, which isn’t always the case with Chromebooks. The touchpad below is nicely sized and wider than some we’ve seen, although not nearly as large as Apple’s luxurious trackpads of late.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever"></a><strong>Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever</strong></h2><p> Setting up a Chromebook is incredibly easy. Just power it on (the button is on the left side), connect to a network, accept the terms of service and choose from any options that you’re prompted to, and then plug in your Google account info. If you do already have a Google account, then any bookmarks, Chrome extensions, and apps will automatically be added. If you don’t have a Google account, then you’ll need to sign up for one to use the Chromebook.

It’s colorful and nicely vibrant, and text and graphics typically look crisp. It’s not one of the brightest screens we’ve seen, with a listed brightness of about 300 nits, but that’s pretty common amongst laptops. It’s a little dimmer than we’d like, admittedly. Visibility is impacted in direct sunlight, but in most situations, it’s hard to complain too much about this screen.</p><p> It also acts like an extra-large tablet screen since it’s a touchscreen with 10 points of interaction. It felt just as responsive as any tablet we’ve used.</p><h2 id="Performance-It-does-what-it-can"><a href="#Performance-It-does-what-it-can" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It does what it can"></a><strong>Performance: It does what it can</strong></h2><p> You really can’t pit the Chromebook Flip against pricier Windows and Mac laptops in terms of sheer processing power because Chromebooks aren’t built to be beasts. But they don’t really need to be: the highest quality of graphics processing it’ll need to handle are mobile-quality games, since the Chromebook Flip can run Android apps from the Play Store, and you’re not able to download high-end games from Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p><p> The version of the Chromebook Flip we tested came with a 2.2Ghz Intel Core M3-6Y30 chip, although you can get versions with a Core M7 or Pentium 4405Y chip for more power. Paired with 4GB RAM, we found the device to be plenty speedy getting around Chrome OS.</p><p> Compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p> Given the access to the Play Store, we benchmarked the Chromebook Flip using the same tests we use for Android phones, with a score of 8,818 on the PCMark 2.0 Work test. The Intel HD Graphics 515 integrated graphics, meanwhile, delivered a frame rate of 12 frames per second in the Car Chase demo and 53 frames per second in the T-Rex demo. Essentially, the Chromebook Flip seems comparable to an upper mid-range Android phone.</p><p> That comparison held up when playing Android racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, which ran at a pretty smooth clip but definitely looked fuzzier than usual thanks to being blown up for the larger screen. Online battle royale shooter PUBG Mobile also ran solidly, although the keyboard and trackpad combination didn’t feel right. We folded the screen back entirely and just used the touchscreen, which worked fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7B1-43v0GHPcS2HESabWT97_XPQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_Keyboard_03-8bc37c7c2d0243bb8ed1fa10e338374f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Audio-Sounds-fine"><a href="#Audio-Sounds-fine" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Sounds fine"></a><strong>Audio: Sounds fine</strong></h2><p> The tiny speaker grates on the left and right side of the Chromebook Flip don’t look too promising, but the playback quality was better than expected. Music output isn’t big and bold, but it’s pretty clear and it can get loud without getting too muddled. Video playback via YouTube and Netflix was sometimes too quiet at full volume, however.</p><h2 id="Network-No-complaints-here"><a href="#Network-No-complaints-here" class="headerlink" title="Network: No complaints here"></a><strong>Network: No complaints here</strong></h2><p> The Chromebook Flip has dual-band Wi-Fi that can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks, and we had no issues with either during our testing. We went online at a home network and a Starbucks Google network alike, and things were routinely speedy. On the home network, we saw speeds of about 33Mbps and upload speeds in excess of 10Mbps—essentially the same as we’ve seen with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >other laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth"><a href="#Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Nearly a day’s worth"></a><strong>Battery: Nearly a day’s worth</strong></h2><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life. The 39Wh battery cell is rated for up to 10 hours, and while that estimate is ambitious for everyday use, we typically saw seven or more hours of mixed usage with the screen at full brightness. That’s for our usual workflow of surfing the web, typing out documents, watching some YouTube videos, and streaming music from Spotify.</p><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life.</p><p> Our laptop video rundown test, which streams a Netflix movie over Wi-Fi while at 100 percent brightness, delivered a similar result: it lasted 6 hours, 57 minutes before the Chromebook Flip shut down. In both use cases, we were pleasantly surprised by the battery performance of the device—it even beat the 2018 MacBook Air.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VR5Y-1tDILHowNSeA408pnLVtgg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_closed_04-bde5ec8f988c4bb49e4019f95cc47c31.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Software-It’s-definitely-different"><a href="#Software-It’s-definitely-different" class="headerlink" title="Software: It’s definitely different"></a><strong>Software: It’s definitely different</strong></h2><p> ChromeOS delivers an experience that’s halfway between a desktop PC and an Android tablet. It’s a much simpler approach to PC usage, focusing only on essential features and functionality. The interface has a PC-like bar at the bottom, but it’s really more like an app dock on your phone or tablet. Unsurprisingly, the experience is built around Google’s own apps, coming preloaded with the Chrome web browser, Google Docs, YouTube, Google Photos, Google Maps, and more.</p><p> Since the Chromebook Flip’s original release, Google has added the ability to run Android apps downloaded from the Play Store. This is the same Play Store found on scads of smartphones and tablets the world over, offering access to a wide array of games and apps. Not every app looks or acts perfectly on a larger screen, but we mostly had success: business chat app Slack looked like the desktop version on PC and Mac, as did Spotify. Twitch’s interface just looked like it was stretched out from the phone app, but video still played perfectly.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department.</p><p> Anyone looking for a familiar PC or Mac experience, or a device that can run familiar PC and Mac apps and games, might struggle with using a Chromebook. It’s really meant for casual usage—things like web browsing, watching media, writing, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-lightweight-laptops-to-buy-4065134" >lightweight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> game playing. Need a device primed for high-end, professional creative software? Need something capable of playing the latest and greatest games? That’s not a Chromebook.</p><p> Luckily, the Chromebook’s reputation as an online-only device isn’t true. For example, Google Docs can be used offline, you can view and edit photos, watch locally-stored media, and play games that don’t require an online connection. It’s really not that different in approach to other PCs, but the overall feel and flow of the experience varies in some key ways.</p><h2 id="Price-It-feels-like-a-steal"><a href="#Price-It-feels-like-a-steal" class="headerlink" title="Price: It feels like a steal"></a><strong>Price: It feels like a steal</strong></h2><p> Here’s where the Asus Chromebook Flip really makes its biggest impact. As mentioned, it’s a capable computer for most everyday tasks, it has a very good screen, and the battery life is stellar. Best of all, it’s priced at $499, although you can find it for a little bit less (we’re seeing it around $400-450 lately). There are cheaper Chromebooks out there that skimp on features and functionality, such as skipping the convertible hinge or touch functionality, or using a lower-end processor. You can spend a lot less and still get a solid laptop.</p><p> But the Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department—and compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NHrMPSrgOWsOuCEYg0M-STQUfsU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Air-v-Surface-Comparison-a255967a27e14762b5c2ad9c442df77f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Asus-Chromebook-Flip-C302CA-vs-Apple-MacBook-Air"><a href="#Asus-Chromebook-Flip-C302CA-vs-Apple-MacBook-Air" class="headerlink" title="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA vs. Apple MacBook Air"></a><strong>Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA vs. Apple MacBook Air</strong></h2><p> On paper, these laptops shouldn’t be comparable. At $1,099 or more, the MacBook Air is one of the most polished and premium ultraportable laptops you can buy today. The perks are obvious: it has a sleek and refined build, the brighter and higher-resolution 13.3-inch display is gorgeous, and the touchpad is excellent. It also runs macOS, a more robust operating system that still manages to be easy to use.</p><p> However, if your computer needs are pretty basic—browsing the web, watching videos, and typing up documents and filling out spreadsheets—then you don’t need a higher-end computer. And the Chromebook Flip has better battery life than the MacBook Air while delivering comparable functionality in many key ways. No doubt, the MacBook Air is the higher-quality option, but at $600 more, we’re not sure it’s worth it for most users.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-air-2018-review-4779750" >Apple MacBook Air (2018) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It’s an excellent, affordable laptop.</strong></p><p> Just as the recent crop of cheap, strong mid-range phones has made many flagship smartphones seem excessive and unnecessary, the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA does much the same for laptops. This is a seriously impressive and versatile notebook without any major deficiencies, and it’s priced at just $499—less than half the price of the cheapest Apple laptop right now.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Chromebook Flip C302CA-DHM4</li><li>Product Brand  ASUS</li><li>UPC  889349471715</li><li>Price  $499.99</li><li>Release Date  January 2017</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.97 x 8.28 x 0.54 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  ChromeOS</li><li>Processor  2.2Ghz Intel Core M3-6Y30</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  64GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  39 Wh</li><li>Ports  2x USB-C, microSD, 3.5mm headphone port</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-harmonic-hub-curating-exceptional-dj-visual-downloads/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Harmonic Hub  Curating Exceptional DJ Visual Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-periscope-footage-lifesaving-tips-and-tricks/"><u>[New] Periscope Footage Lifesaving Tips & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-unlock-seamless-mac-screen-captures-with-efficient-shortcuts-guide/"><u>[New] Unlock Seamless Mac Screen Captures with Efficient Shortcuts Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-driving-engagement-and-visibility-effective-strategies-for-fb-video-marketing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Driving Engagement and Visibility  Effective Strategies for FB Video Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-fix-there-is-no-sound-on-twitter-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Fix There Is No Sound on Twitter Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-choose-between-filmora-and-democreator/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Choose Between Filmora and Democreator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/bring-the-theater-home-easy-instructions-for-viewing-3d-movies-via-fandango-online/"><u>Bring the Theater Home: Easy Instructions for Viewing 3D Movies via Fandango Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comparing-giants-a-detailed-look-at-the-samsung-galaxy-s10plus-vs-the-s20/"><u>Comparing Giants: A Detailed Look at the Samsung Galaxy S10+ Vs.

Not only does that mean ensuring you’re subscribed to a fast internet service, but you also have the proper hardware to provide a fast and stable connection whenever needed.</p><p> A home internet network has two main components:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-modem-and-router-4159854" >a modem and a router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The modem converts a cable signal from your internet service provider (ISP) into something a digital device like a computer can understand. The router then distributes that signal to the computers and other connected devices in your home, either via<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338" >wired Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> connections or by beaming it out over Wi-Fi, which is how you get wireless internet connectivity in your home.</p><p> Of course, there are many things to consider when buying a modem. You don’t always need to buy a modem, as you can typically rent one directly from your ISP, although if you do the math, you’ll likely find it makes more financial sense to buy your own. Then, you’ll need to consider whether you want a modem&#x2F;router combo and what features you want from your modem—including what modern connection protocols it supports, the number of channels it offers, and how quickly it can upload and download files.</p><p> Whether you think you know everything you need to or are starting from scratch, here are all the features you should remember while buying a modem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1SZf8UwoZuAHJOglWXBzaJfrml8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-2-5bacf868c9e77c002c9555f3.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><h3 id="When-Should-You-Rent-Your-Cable-Modem"><a href="#When-Should-You-Rent-Your-Cable-Modem" class="headerlink" title="When Should You Rent Your Cable Modem?"></a>When Should You Rent Your Cable Modem?</h3><p> Before diving into the features to consider when buying a modem, it’s worth considering the possibility of renting one from your ISP. The modems on offer by ISPs are generally decent in quality (though not as good as the modems you can buy), plus going with a rental saves you from doing the legwork of finding one on your own. Further, if anything goes wrong with your cable modem, your ISP will take responsibility for fixing or replacing it, often even sending a technician to your home to take care of everything for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9DXQaEhGunRAssafYX-TGybEsSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear-Nighthawk-C7000-5x4-465340ea47c74a319d9e8ae148401aeb.jpg"                      alt="Netgear-Nighthawk C7000"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Generally, though, we recommend against renting a modem from your ISP. Since the rental often comes out to between $10 and $15 per month, you can save a lot of money by purchasing your own. For example, buying a modem&#x2F;router combo for just $75 can quickly recoup your costs in less than a year.</p><p> That doesn’t mean that there aren’t situations in which you should rent a modem. For starters, if you’re not very tech-savvy or don’t like troubleshooting problems, renting a modem may be the way to go, as you’ll often get complete repair services from your ISP.</p><p> For most, we recommend buying your modem. You’ll get much more control over your home network, and after a few years, you’ll have recouped the cost of the devices you would have otherwise had to rent. There’s no need to worry about hardware problems either since they are rare among the more well-known brands, and all come with a standard warranty.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Compatibility-with-Your-ISP"><a href="#Compatibility-with-Your-ISP" class="headerlink" title="Compatibility with Your ISP"></a>Compatibility with Your ISP</h3><p> There are other advantages to buying your modem. For starters, the modems you can rent from your ISP are usually on the older side and may not offer as fast or stable of a connection as you could get with something more modern. Most of the time, ISP modems lack features, preventing you from getting much control over your home network, which might be vital if you want to tweak your network’s settings.</p><p> Before buying a modem, it’s worth double-checking that the modem you’re interested in is compatible with your ISP. Unfortunately, not all modems are supported by every ISP. Most ISPs will have a list of compatible modems on their website, or, at the very least, you should be able to contact customer service to find out.</p><p> If you subscribe to voice services from your ISP, such as Xfinity from Comcast Internet with Voice, you must ensure that the cable modem you purchase supports your provider’s voice services. While it’s theoretically possible to run your old voice-capable cable modem in parallel with a newer, high-performance modem, this can get messy and needs to be supported in some cases. Besides, the main point of buying a cable modem is that you don’t have to keep paying rental fees for the old one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mczhPmklHisJ3nV93MiYFCIrGPA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-4-5bacf875c9e77c0025819a90.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700 combo"                ></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1?<br> DOCSIS, a short form for “Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification,” is the technology on which all cable modems are based. DOCSIS 3.0 is the standard currently being used by almost all cable providers, but even though it offers theoretical speeds of up to 1Gbps, most ISPs in the U.S. don’t go beyond 600Mbps over DOCSIS 3.0. You’ll need a DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem to get actual multi-gigabit plans. Don’t worry if your ISP doesn’t support the newer standard yet, though, as all DOCSIS 3.1 modems are fully backward compatible with DOCSIS 3.0, so you can buy one now to be ready when those faster speeds do come along.</li><li>What happens if your cable modem breaks down?<br> While it’s true that one of the advantages of renting your cable modem from your ISP is they’ll easily swap it out if you have any problems—something that won’t be an option if you’ve bought your own—the reality is that modern cable modems are very reliable as long as you go with a trusted brand, and almost all of them also come with 1–2 year warranties.</li><li>What about cable modem&#x2F;router combos?<br> If you’re in the market for a new wireless router, it might be worth considering a cable modem&#x2F;router combo instead since you’ll get the best of both worlds in a much more affordable package. There’s rarely any good reason to go that route if you’re pleased with the Wi-Fi router you already have, though any cable modem should work just fine with any relatively modern router.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-profit-peaks-techniques-to-maximize-revenue-from-mobile-youtube-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Profit Peaks  Techniques to Maximize Revenue From Mobile YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-diverse-iptv-platforms-integration/"><u>[New] Diverse IPTV Platforms Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-embrace-classic-gaming-leading-ps3-tools-for-pcs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Embrace Classic Gaming  Leading PS3 Tools for PCs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/n-2024-create-a-standout-presence-with-youtube-custom-imagery/"><u>[New] In 2024, Create a Standout Presence with YouTube Custom Imagery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-effortlessly-record-screens-on-your-hp-device/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Effortlessly Record Screens on Your HP Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-art-of-audio-amalgamation-in-vimeo-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Art of Audio Amalgamation in Vimeo Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-budget-friendly-ticking-clocks-online/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Best Budget-Friendly Ticking Clocks Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-archive-snaps-from-android-plus-mac-systems-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Archive Snaps From Android + Mac Systems for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-harvest-hangouts-the-most-friendly-farm-gaming-experiences/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Harvest Hangouts  The Most Friendly Farm Gaming Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-instagram-reels-harnessing-tiktok-secrets-for-popularity-surge/"><u>[Updated] Instagram Reels  Harnessing TikTok Secrets for Popularity Surge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-fundamentals-of-vimeo-video-logging/"><u>[Updated] The Fundamentals of Vimeo Video Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-integrating-gentle-decreases-into-your-audience-experience-via-audacity/"><u>2024 Approved  Integrating Gentle Decreases Into Your Audience Experience via Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-review-of-sonys-unusual-design-in-ws623/"><u>A Review of Sonys Unusual Design in WS623</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/amazonbasics-tripod-ideal-support-for-new-shutterbugs/"><u>AmazonBasics Tripod - Ideal Support for New Shutterbugs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-sonic-prowess-of-soundbot-sb210-superior-clarity-during-optimal-function/"><u>Analyzing the Sonic Prowess of Soundbot SB210 - Superior Clarity During Optimal Function</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/assessing-quality-and-performance-a-detailed-review-of-the-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano/"><u>Assessing Quality and Performance: A Detailed Review of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/battle-of-the-behemoths-tp-link-archer-ax6000-against-nighthawk-ax12-the-ultimate-wifi-comparison/"><u>Battle of the Behemoths: TP-Link Archer AX6000 Against Nighthawk AX12 – The Ultimate WiFi Comparison</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/bikers-vs-zombies-an-exciting-journey-in-days-gone/"><u>Bikers Vs.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg"                      border="0"                >PearlMountain Image Converter</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a class="link"   href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1" >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C302 Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  TopMate</li><li>MPN  C302</li><li>Price  $30.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2016</li><li>Weight  1.09 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.2 x 10.43 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Ports  USB-A</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-interactive-instagram-flipbook-feature/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Interactive Instagram Flipbook Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-earn-online-via-youtube-how-reaching-500-subscribers-pays-off-for-2024/"><u>[New] Earn Online via YouTube  How Reaching 500 Subscribers Pays Off for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capture-and-save-windows-screen-shots-made-simple-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capture and Save  Windows Screen Shots Made Simple for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-capture-and-store-facebook-videos-in-hd-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capture and Store Facebook Videos in HD for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-flip-order-3-easy-steps-to-rewind-youtube-listeners/"><u>[Updated] Flip Order  3 Easy Steps to Rewind Youtube Listeners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-comparing-youtube-and-dailymotion-notable-contrasts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Comparing YouTube and Dailymotion  Notable Contrasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-buyers-checklist-critical-points-for-investing-in-an-used-ipad/"><u>A Buyer's Checklist: Critical Points for Investing in an Used iPad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-performance-in-depth-tp-link-archer-a9-router-evaluation-best-options-below-100/"><u>Affordable Performance: In-Depth TP-Link Archer A9 Router Evaluation -

channel</li><li>No USB ports</li></ul><p> TP-Link has built a reputation for itself recently with some surprisingly affordable Wi-Fi 6 routers, and the Deco X20 is no exception. This small but mighty mesh system represents a way to get into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without emptying your wallet.</p><p> The X20 is a good choice for users who need broad coverage, with three units handling homes of up to 5,800 square feet. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 support offers a comfortable 1.8Mbps bandwidth, although this is only partially on par with some of the pricier alternatives in this list.</p><p> But more importantly, the Deco X20 lacks the dedicated backhaul channel on more advanced mesh Wi-Fi systems. This means it may not perform as well on busy and heavily congested home networks — those with a dozen or more devices gaming, video calling, and streaming in 4K—but it should be more than enough for the online needs of smaller families.</p><p> The Deco X20 is a breeze to set up, thanks to TP-Link’s aptly named Deco app, which can help even the most inexperienced home networking users get up and running within a few minutes. It also includes TP-Link’s new HomeCare security suite, powered by Trend Micro. It offers anti-malware features and parental controls to keep your home network safe against intruders and kids away from the internet’s darker corners. Each unit includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect non-wireless devices, but sadly, there aren’t any USB ports for sharing external storage devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> HomeCare, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX1800 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><h2 id="Best-Parental-Controls"><a href="#Best-Parental-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Best Parental Controls"></a>Best Parental Controls</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >Netgear Orbi Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e0pqAK3I9BIPd_HjQl8z5DRaZ-I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-orbi-whole-home-wi-fi-system-41457ad2356b431eb21ef92d6fc06f7e.jpg" >Netgear Orbi Whole Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >$225 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast and reliable coverage</li><li>Easy to set up</li><li>Highly configurable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>USB ports don’t support shared storage</li></ul><p> Netgear’s Orbi strikes an almost perfect balance of performance, price, and features among mesh Wi-Fi systems. With only two units, Orbi can provide fast and stable Wi-Fi over an area of up to 5,000 square feet, and this range can be easily extended by adding additional units.</p><p> Netgear promises that Orbi can deliver at least 150Mbps anywhere in your home, which was more than evident in our testing. You’ll enjoy smooth online performance throughout your living space without worrying about buffering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830" >Netflix 4K UHD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> streams or stuttering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476" >Zoom calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Orbi accomplishes this by dedicating the fastest of its three Wi-Fi bands as a backhaul channel. Remember that in a mesh network, data to or from your device may pass from one access point to the following multiple times before it reaches your router and moves on to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924" >Internet Service Provider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network. The backhaul channel provides dedicated bandwidth for this pass-through traffic, ensuring you’ll get the same excellent wireless performance whether your devices are closer to the central unit or one of the satellite units.</p><p> This also makes the collection of four Gigabit Ethernet ports found on each unit even more helpful, as you can plug in things like a TV and not see a drop in speed. Each also has a USB 2.0 port for sharing printers around your home. The partnership between Netgear and Circle with Disney offers advanced security and parental controls.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> NETGEAR Armor, WPA2, Guest Wi-Fi Secure Access, Circle with Disney |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC3000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8avh1Ze3JbmbKGNMK8KABSk5mCY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearOrbi-899149c3f879469788d6c8f71f0c885b.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Bill Thomas</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Range"><a href="#Best-Range" class="headerlink" title="Best Range"></a>Best Range</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK" >Linksys Velop MX12600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-dYI3_OihGLEiIYzSq9ZD_Qv5qo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ax4200-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-mx12600-eac5daec45984003b0a35fe55eddd1b9.jpg" >Linksys Velop AX4200 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System (MX12600) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK" >$200 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/101526375" >$364 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPN52LL/A/linksys-velop-ax4200-wifi-6-mesh-system-3-pack" >$500 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Tri-band Wi-Fi 6</li><li>Expansive coverage</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Requires mobile app for initial set up</li><li>Not good for multi-gigabit broadband</li><li>Lacks advanced features</li></ul><p> When getting maximum coverage out of your mesh Wi-Fi system, Linksys’ Velop system will give you the best bang for your buck. The MX 12600 bundle includes three identical Wi-Fi 6 capable AX4200 mesh units (three times 4,200 is 12,600, see?) for less than most other systems charge for only two. This means solid and reliable performance for homes of up to 8,100 square feet at an affordable price.</p><p> You’ll designate one of these units as the primary router that hosts your broadband connection, then place the other two wherever you need the best and strongest coverage in your home. The Velop system also features a “dynamic” backhaul channel: The system intelligently decides which of the three Wi-Fi bands is best suited to move traffic between the mesh stations and which should be available for your Wi-Fi clients.</p><p> Each unit also includes four Gigabit Ethernet ports, letting you hardwire in non-Wi-Fi devices. And thanks to a high-speed USB 3.2 port on the back of each unit, you can connect multiple hard drives or other storage devices for sharing files or even streaming media.</p><p> Linksys’ mobile app also makes the system a cinch to set up, walking you through getting the first unit online and then joining the other two into a single mesh network. Although you’ll need to use the mobile app for the initial configuration, you can manage the system from the more familiar web interface once the mesh has been configured.</p><p> The MX12600 system offers all the basic networking features you’d expect from a modern router, including elementary Quality of Service (QoS) support (which prioritizes devices based on the type of service they’re using. There are rudimentary parental controls, but they should be enough for most typical users. However, those hoping for advanced features like a built-in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-vpn-5189778" >VPN server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or online malware protection will want to look elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX4200 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><h2 id="Best-Splurge"><a href="#Best-Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Best Splurge"></a>Best Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WNY2WKG/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07WNY2WKG" >Netgear Orbi Wi-Fi 6 System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RddPc31H_i75vLjwxQ1uOpgprg0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-orbi-ax6000-wi-fi-6-mesh-system-b7ee66c77706432b8dac9306a374c4a1.jpg" >Netgear Orbi AX6000 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WNY2WKG/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07WNY2WKG" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WNY2WKG/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07WNY2WKG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WNY2WKG/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB07WNY2WKG" >$389 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/828235773" >$415 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/netgear-orbi-wifi-system-rbk852-wi-fi-system-router-extender-up-to-5000-sqft-mesh-gige-25-gige-80211a-b-g-n-ac-80211a-b-g-n-ac-ax-tri-band/apd/ab703867/networking?slfpid=3" >$430 at Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Blazing fast performance</li><li>Excellent range</li><li>2.5Gbps WAN port</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Very expensive</li><li>Lacks some advanced features</li><li>No USB ports</li></ul><p> Thanks to its use of Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax technology, the AX6000 is one of the fastest mesh network solutions available, even when you have a lot of devices on your network; the much higher network capacity offered by Wi-Fi 6 means it can easily handle up to 100 devices without breaking a sweat.</p><p> The Orbi system offers 6Gbps of total bandwidth, and we found it can maintain these impressive speeds even at the edges of its range. Since a two-unit system will give you 5,000 square feet of Wi-Fi coverage (which can be expanded by adding up to five more satellite units), you’ll be sure to see consistently fast speeds anywhere in your home.</p><p> Netgear has also packed in four Gigabit Ethernet ports on each station, so you’ll have plenty of room for wiring in devices like game consoles for maximum performance.

The lack of advanced configuration settings may also let power users down compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers.

The second generation of Google’s mesh solution, Nest Wi-Fi’s satellite units (called “point” units) double as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smart speakers. So, it’s an especially great choice for anyone already invested in the Google ecosystem. You can issue voice commands to control smart appliances, check the weather, send messages, and set up calendar appointments.</p><p> Three units—the central base station and two points—provide up to 5,400 square feet of coverage. Google’s Home and Wi-Fi apps make this an absolute cinch to set up and manage. It even lets you set up a guest network for your friends and other visitors and let them get online simply by<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >scanning a QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The main downside to Nest Wi-Fi is that the base station includes only one Ethernet LAN port, and you won’t find any at all on the satellite points, so you’ll need to add your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ethernet-and-network-hubs-816358" >network hub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to hardwire in some of your devices at the router. And if you need to wire in devices at the points, you’ll want to look elsewhere.</p><p> Additionally, the Nest doesn’t support the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard like some of the other systems here, so if you need maximum performance or are a stickler for future-proofing your network, the Nest may not be the best option.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC2200 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O_4HqL-cj7KOoa_JTrVN--P752o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleNestWi-Fi-9704c0e2a822442d89253e49f44d9948.jpg"                      alt="Google Nest Wi-Fi"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-nest-wi-fi-review-4846243" >Google Nest Wi-Fi Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >Linksys Velop AC6600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/j4p01isOS24wSYnZhkkDN75cgIU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ac6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-system-c5531ec228e247eb88bb7d05247c3842.jpg" >Linksys Velop AC6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >$170 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/55384671" >$170 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcrichard.com/linksys-velop-whole-home-mesh-wi-fi-system-3-pack/WHW0303.html?slpfid=3" >View on Pcrichard.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Strong, consistent connection</li><li>Sleek Design</li><li>Great range</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some basic settings</li><li>Some features cost extra</li></ul><p> Linksys’ first whole home Wi-Fi system, the Velop Tri-Band AC6600, is one of the more attractive designs we’ve seen. Each sleek white node is roughly the size of a tower of Jenga blocks, and they look nice enough to sit on display rather than being hidden away. Linksys sells Velop nodes individually or in packs of two or three; each will give you about 2,000 square feet of coverage. So, a complete system can blanket a 6,000-square-foot home.</p><p> The Velop AC6600 system includes tri-band Wi-Fi and dedicates the second 5GHz band as a backhaul channel. This means it can keep traffic moving smoothly between all units for maximum performance throughout your home, even if one is under heavy usage. The downside is that your devices won’t be able to take advantage of the extra 5GHz band, so even though each of these AC2200 routers can theoretically provide 2,134Mbps of throughput, only 1,267Mbps of that total is available to your devices.</p><p> The Velop offers a simplified setup process thanks to the Linksys smartphone app. However, if you like to tinker with your network settings, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere since it has limited configuration options. There’s also no malware protection, and parental controls are confined to blocking websites and manually restricting internet access from specific devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SkmNvOHzz4u2QHpClMEbMhzcBbQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LinksysVelopAC6600-2fd0f211926949cd9e38646f533fb981-6b8bc5f3009346dfaee7ef6b86357f34.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop AC6600"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png"                      border="0"                >Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

Mesh Wi-Fi network systems are designed to solve this problem by placing a number of nodes throughout your home or business, creating a uniformly strong signal with no dead spots.</p><p> Unlike traditional routers with wireless extenders and access points, mesh systems are designed from the ground up to work as a node-based system. Setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network system is typically a lot easier than connecting range extenders to an existing system, and they automatically pass your connection from one node to the next as you move around your home.</p><p> The main drawback of mesh Wi-Fi network systems is the price, as they tend to be more expensive than traditional routers. You can typically buy a nice router and some extenders for less than a mesh Wi-Fi starter kit, but if your situation really calls for a mesh system, it’s well worth the additional investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFk9VbnycX8txbFO35hsBW2ZGvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-2_1-5c8fbca346e0fb000172f07e.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><h3 id="Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use"><a href="#Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?"></a>Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?</h3><p> Most mesh Wi-Fi network systems support a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-connected-home-817684" >smart home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> integration system, and a few support more than one.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the most commonly supported, with integration from manufacturers like Eero, Linksys, Netgear, and more. Philips Hue,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ifttt-4172417" >IFTTT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and others see less integration.</p><p> If you already have some smart devices in your home, and you’re already tied into either the Alexa or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-home-and-how-does-it-work-4801919" >Google Home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ecosystem, then that should inform your decision regarding which mesh Wi-Fi network system to choose, but keep in mind that you don’t technically need your router to support your smart home assistant unless you need to be able to control its features with voice commands, such as enabling your guest network or blocking access to your kids’ devices.</p><p> If you’re an Apple HomeKit user, then the iPhone maker has taken a different approach. You won’t find any routers that can be controlled via Siri, however, a few mesh systems are adding HomeKit-specific security features to keep your smart home devices protected from network intrusions, which is something that neither Google Home nor Amazon Alexa yet offers.</p><h3 id="Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs"><a href="#Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs"></a>Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs</h3><p> Since mesh systems are high-end equipment, they typically include robust security options and parental controls. There are a handful of systems that don’t include either, so look for those if you don’t have kids and prefer to manage security on individual devices.</p><p> The most important thing to check in this area is whether or not the security and parental controls of the mesh system you’re interested in require a subscription. Basic security options are often free, but the best-advanced protections and parental controls often come at the cost of an ongoing monthly subscription, so make sure to take that into account.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi extender?<br> Mesh Wi-Fi systems and Wi-Fi extenders extend the reach of your wireless signal beyond your main router’s range. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are more tightly integrated, with the main and satellite devices expressly designed to work in concert.</li><li>Are mesh Wi-Fi systems faster?<br> Technically speaking, a mesh Wi-Fi system won’t offer better performance than an equivalent standalone router when you’re sitting right beside it. Since speed always falls off due to a weaker signal as you move farther away from your router, mesh systems can make a difference in larger homes.</li><li>Do you need to replace your existing router?<br> In most cases, the answer is yes. Although some mesh Wi-Fi systems can work with existing routers, you’ll generally get better performance and a much better user experience if you use a full mesh Wi-Fi system. If you’re a cable internet subscriber, you’ll still need to hang onto your cable modem.</li><li>How fast is a mesh Wi-Fi system?<br> Since mesh Wi-Fi network systems are uniformly high-end, they are also pretty fast. If your home internet connection isn’t very fast, then there isn’t any benefit to choosing a speedier mesh system over a slower one. You can check your internet connection speed with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-test-sites-2626177" >free speed tests <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you aren’t sure what it is.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-customize-your-screenscape-google-meets-dynamic-background-switch-for-2024/"><u>[New] Customize Your Screenscape  Google Meet's Dynamic Background Switch for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-disrupted-beats-best-mobile-music-distortors-for-2024/"><u>[New] Disrupted Beats  Best Mobile Music Distortors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discover-the-cheapest-action-cameras-below-100-budget/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discover the Cheapest ACTION Cameras Below $100 Budget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-hot-pursuit-of-snaps-tactics-for-uninterrupted-streaks/"><u>[New] In 2024, Hot Pursuit of Snaps -

Its 256GB storage space is impressive, and its read and write (data transfer) speeds reach 420Mbps and 380Mbps, respectively.</p><p> To put these speeds in perspective, imagine you had 2GB of data. At these speeds, it can transfer the files to a computer in about 40 seconds and transfer them back in about 42 seconds.</p><p> For comparison, our budget recommendation (read speed of 100Mbps and write speeds of up to 30–35Mbps) would take about two minutes and 40 seconds to transfer the files to a computer and nearly nine minutes to transfer them back.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" >An Explanation of Read and Write Speeds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In addition to its generous storage space and speed, we thoroughly enjoyed its weighty and sturdy feel. Holding it in hand feels just right, with an even weight distribution throughout. An included keychain hole also helps you attach it to whatever you need (hello, backpack pocket liner!).</p><p> While the SanDisk Extreme PRO is a fantastic device, it’s important to note a few design quirks. The retractable plug is convenient feature, but it can sometimes feel stuck and isn’t as smooth as we’d like.</p><p> However, a simple adjustment in how you push the plug can quickly resolve this. Push your thumb against the retractable plug’s side rather than in the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VzaKxOdaMFqGHZPPFjBAiNP-s3Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_SanDisk256GBExtremePROUSB3.2SolidStateFlashDrive-3517c6beda944a6eb980e748d694c880.jpg"                      alt="SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Solid State Flash Drive."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> This minor inconvenience is unlikely to be a major issue unless you use it constantly.</p><p> Another feature we appreciate about the Extreme PRO is the included RescuePRO Deluxe data recovery suite, which makes it very easy to recover accidentally deleted files. Separately, SanDisk SecureAccess software keeps your information secure using 128-bit encryption.</p><p> Overall, we see the SanDisk Extreme PRO as a true jack of all trades, even compared to other higher-end options on the market.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong>  The SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO has received glowing reviews, with Wirecutter recommending it in its USB flash drive guide.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong>  Most buyers have nothing but good things to say about the SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO on Amazon.

To put that into perspective, it equates to a whopping 209,000 5MB files, enough for a music library that even the most famous international DJ would need, so you’re well covered. Other storage options (128GB and 256GB) exist as well.</p><p> When it comes to usability, this Flash Survivor Stealth USB simply rocks. Hold it and enjoy a sturdy aluminum construction with center ridges for a comfortable grip.</p><p> It’s also waterproof up to 200 meters, though we were in no hurry to submerge it with valuable data inside and find out if it was true.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

Grab the keychain loop, unscrew it counterclockwise, and pull it out, revealing the slimmer casing underneath and the USB port. To put it back, pop it in and rotate the end clockwise until it becomes tight (like a bottle cap).</p><p> If there’s one thing we’d improve about the design, it’s the keychain loop. Its integration into the design means the hole is relatively small and difficult to spot. It may also make it hard to clip onto larger key rings. However, keychain loops aren’t crucial for USB flash drives, so we’ll pardon Corsair for this minor usability issue.</p><p><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth has seen stellar ratings on sites like TweakTown.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> If you look at the Amazon reviews, most Corsair users are pretty ecstatic. Its average 4.5-star rating covers everything from the unit’s durability to its 1TB storage capacity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xOv4XG2m0FAXv2xnn1MqZOuo9o8=/fit-in/1500x1368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kingston-DataTraveler70-be3585b8673644689895fb96814e0e4c.jpg" >Kingston DataTraveler 70 USB-C flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-256GB-USB-C-DT70/dp/B0BSGD5ZB8?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4141193%7Cna32008de9e534dcea3c0c57c5e79d33117%7CB0BSGD5ZB8" >$20 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid storage capacity (256GB)</li><li>Moderate reading and writing speeds</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Plastic end caps can be tricky to remove with moist hands</li><li>Good, but not excellent, build quality</li><li>Not as many Amazon ratings as our other recs</li></ul><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is a budget performer, boasting an impressive 256GB storage capacity (great for the price!) and decent, though not exceptional, build quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is one of our favorite budget USB drive options. It’s straightforward with few frills, allowing you to easily store your favorite playlist. It boasts a modest read speed of up to 100Mbps and writes speeds of up to 30–35 Mbps.</p><p> A transfer rate of up to 100Mbps means that a large 1GB file can be transferred in less than 10 seconds straight from your Kingston to your device. It performs pretty well with no lag time in opening files, unlike other comparably priced options we’ve tested that missed the mark.</p><p> The Kingston DataTraveler 70 is pretty basic in terms of design. Shaped like a traditional pen drive, it features a plastic end cap and a slight concave ridge for a sturdy grip. Be sure to have dry hands when pulling off the end cap, as it can get stuck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6spSWh77t1fzmOyoTMN9i0PhDg0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/USB_KingstonDataTraveler70256GBUSB-CFlashDrive-06fc6657c36c4e7c80b44488c73e4b80.jpg"                      alt="Kingston DataTraveler 70 256GB USB-C Flash Drive."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Raymond Prince</p><p> We recommend this USB flash drive for anyone seeking a quick and affordable solution.

Each excels in different areas.</p><p> To earn passing marks, all of our reviewed USB flash drives must shine in all of the following areas:</p><ul><li>Storage capacity</li><li>Read and write speeds</li><li>Build quality and cost</li></ul><p> Naturally, storage capacity is a matter of preference. An international music DJ may require one terabyte, while a hobbyist may be satisfied with 250GB.</p><p> We also prioritized the highest read and write speeds for our top two picks. Read speed refers to how fast the USB drive can retrieve data from a device (phone, laptop, etc.), whereas write speed refers to how quickly data can be stored.</p><p> If you rarely transfer large files, try to aim for at least 50Mbps read speeds and 20Mbps write speeds. For more regular, large file transfers, we recommend no less than 100Mbps read speeds and 50Mbps write speeds.</p><p> Don’t skimp on build quality either, with a preference toward rugged constructions like the military-grade aluminum Corsair that can withstand plenty of punishment in your bag or purse.</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> When you’re searching for the best overall USB flash drive, it all boils down to individual preferences.</p><p> How many files are you looking to save? For example, if you only have a modest photo library (say, 20,000 5MB photos), then a 100GB USB drive will suffice. Anything more than that, and 256GB or even 1TB options could be your best bet.</p><p> If you only care about fast transfers, try to get the fastest read and write speeds available. Aim for anything over 100 Mbps for read speed and above 30Mbps for writing speed. Remember, writing speed will almost always be slower than reading speed.</p><p> Read our <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-size-usb-flash-drive-do-i-need-2640421" >USB Drive buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Brands-We-Consider"><a href="#Brands-We-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Brands We Consider"></a>Brands We Consider</h3><ul><li>Aneew</li><li>Corsair</li><li>Kingston</li><li>SanDisk</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-for-music-2438381" >The Best USB Flash Drives to Store Music in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Should you buy an external hard drive or a USB flash drive?<br> Consider an external hard drive if you’re looking for a large amount of storage, faster transfer speeds, and don’t mind a large form factor and higher cost. A USB flash drive is the way to go for smaller amounts of data in the most portable size available (and even greater plug-and-play convenience).</li><li>Are USB flash drives good for backing up data long term?<br> Flash drives are some of the less reliable storage mediums and are designed (and best used) as temporary envelopes for data transfer. Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are the best solution for long-term backup, providing the most data stability and capacity for the price. Or, for a faster solution at a higher price tag, consider a solid disk drive (SSD).</li><li>What’s the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB-C flash drives?<br> The USB standard a flash drive is built around will determine its potential performance, including the maximum transfer rate. For instance, the transfer ceiling for USB 3.0 is theoretically ten times higher than 2.0. Letters following a USB designation (like USB-A, USB-B, or USB-C) indicate the physical type of connection; USB-A is the familiar rectangle most associated with the standard, while USB-C is a reversible flat oval.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-classroom-captures-unveiling-the-ultimate-10-video-recorders-for-education/"><u>[New] Classroom Captures  Unveiling the Ultimate 10 Video Recorders for Education</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-gear-up-for-glory-your-top-5-pick-of-racing-titles/"><u>[New] Gear Up for Glory  Your Top 5 Pick of Racing Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pro-grade-gopro-comparison-hero5-b-and-sessions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Pro-Grade GoPro Comparison  Hero5 B & Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-secure-your-videos-top-5-fb-downloader-apps-ranked-for-2024/"><u>[New] Secure Your Videos  Top 5 FB Downloader Apps Ranked for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-top-tech-gadgets-for-effortless-virtual-meetings-capture/"><u>[New] Top Tech Gadgets for Effortless Virtual Meetings Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-add-timestamp-on-youtube-video-link-desktop-and-mobile/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Add Timestamp on YouTube Video Link?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR sound card was a great card in 2013. In 2019, however, the ZxR has started to lag behind the competition. It provides pretty clear audio, but it requires two PCIe slots and costs $250 MSRP. Compare this to products from other audio card manufacturers, such as ASUS and EVGA, which been able to provide better audio performance for as little as $160. That said, the Sound Blaster ZxR isn’t without merits: it has a lot of inputs and outputs, extensive EQ software, and still produces quality sound. It also has features gamers need, such as treble boost and voice isolation, and it accommodates 6.3mm auxiliary input and output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U_vmwZDe5HbbungQ5L2hzf2LVto=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-4-b0d1cca56ec04a61b83e20d1cecf2aea.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-convenient"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-convenient" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and convenient"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and convenient</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR features a black and red chassis on its main and daughter boards, brightly accented in gold around the transistors and back plate. Together, the cards have enough outputs to natively support a 5.1 surround sound speaker system. They have 2 RCA outputs, 2 3.5mm outputs, two RCA inputs, one optical TOSLINK input, one optical TOSLINK output, one 6.3mm microphone input, and one 6.3 headphone output jack. The ZxR also comes with an Audio Control Module (ACM), which is Creative Labs’ take on an amplifier and on extending the 6.3mm connections. It has both 3.5mm and 6.3mm inputs and outputs so you can choose where you’d like to plug in your headphones and microphone. On the ACM’s face lies a big, plastic volume knob that controls the headphones’ loudness.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Some-odd-decisions"><a href="#Hardware-Some-odd-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Hardware: Some odd decisions"></a><strong>Hardware: Some odd decisions</strong></h2><p> For users who may own higher impedance headphones, the amplifier can comfortably drive headphones with up to a 600 ohm impedance. Unfortunately, the volume control on the ACM works passively by altering the output impedance, which can distort audio on headphones with high inductance like the Sennheiser HD800 (see “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-output-impedance-4690092" >How Low Should Output Impedance Be? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ”). A better and only slightly more costly solution for Creative Labs would have been to have the knob control the ZxR’s in-built volume control rather than try to do it passively. The HD800 sounded fine when plugged directly into the sound card and using the system volume control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1t84P8oe4qch2aJ6lknx0lwunWw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-2-de43d07bd3db40a282f55347c8956c9a.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup"><a href="#Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup"></a><strong>Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup</strong></h2><p> To install the hardware, we popped open our mid-size PC tower and inserted the sound card and daughter board into two available PCIe slots. Creative Labs had the foresight to build the main card with a PCIe 1x slots, giving the user flexibility in where they connect their cards to the motherboard. Once the cards were secured, we plugged the headphones and microphone into the corresponding jacks.</p><p> It’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP.</p><p> Unfortunately, configuring Creative Labs’ drivers and software suite was a much less intuitive process. The ZxR’s outputs are controlled via the Sound Blaster Z-series Software, where users can select whether they’re listening with their headphones or their speakers, apply EQ effects, and more. By default, the software is set to output to speakers with several different EQ effects turned on. We had to manually switch it to headphone output and turn off EQ; the software does not automatically detect which jacks are in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6uorHzKoJdW1FBv0B5ZfeoE8XzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-3-17de2156e4294b5c85f151bd0cd97aa4.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Audio-Excellent-sound"><a href="#Audio-Excellent-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Excellent sound"></a><strong>Audio: Excellent sound</strong></h2><p> Once the EQ effects are turned off, the Sound Blaster ZxR provides beautiful sound. While it wasn’t quite as clean or crisp as an enthusiast audiophile amplifier, such as the OPPO HA-1, it was solid for a system that costs a quarter of the HA-1’s price. On the HD-800s, the bass came across slightly muddy, but the ZxR provides solid quality for consumer-grade headphones like the Sennheiser GSP300 or the Sony MDR-7506. As our our<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/headphones-buying-guide-4172763" >headphone buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggests, most headphones under $250 will not be sensitive enough to meaningfully distinguish between the ZxR and the HA-1.</p><p> Should you happen to own dynamic headphones, you should find their impedance curve. Dynamic headphones with a high impedance may be distorted by the ACM, thanks to the ACM’s high resistance. How your headphones will be affected depends on their impedance curve: for the HD800s, for example, there is a peak at 100Hz (this range captures electric bass and the lower octaves of guitars), so the upper bass range is boosted relative to the other frequencies in the audio. Increasing the volume on the ACM reduces its output resistance and in turn reduces the distortion, but it may be easier to plug equipment directly into the sound card and use the system volume instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1CZw4BSxxTqlBF1kxT0_rl73XCU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-5-e1022e9adc854517af98407c4be32691.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options with mixed utility"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options with mixed utility</strong></h2><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package. Here, you can EQ any frequency between 20 and 20,000 Hz or activate “Crystallization,” “Scout Mode,” and “Theater Mode.” Crystallization adds punch to the audio’s treble, making voices stand out against the background. Theater Mode is similar to Crystallization, but it tries to_only_ boost voices instead of the entire treble range. We found it great for watching videos. Meanwhile, Scout Mode is squarely aimed at gamers. It theoretically makes enemy noises like footsteps louder.</p><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package.</p><p> When testing Scout Mode in_Overwatch_ , we did not find the adjustment helpful; Scout Mode made our enemies’ and our allies’ movements louder, making it harder to tell where the enemy was coming from. Without adjustments,<em>Overwatch’s</em> audio already makes the enemies’ movements louder than your allies’, making Scout Mode not only ineffective but an active detriment to gameplay. Other games that strongly rely on situational awareness have also likely invested the time into making enemies’ movements noticeable. Overall the software modifications Sound Blaster provides are situationally useful but not the comprehensive range of options we’d like to see at this price point.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

Its 6.3mm audio and microphone jacks, coupled with support for headphone impedance of up to 600 ohms, gives the listener flexibility in the rest of their audio setup: no need for 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapters or extension cords. One major hardware disappointment is its lack of 7.1 surround compatibility, which is something many sound card enthusiasts prize in a high-end sound card. There are also a number of other products with better sound quality for less than the ZxR’s $250 MSRP.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short of less expensive options"></a><strong>Competition:</strong> <strong>Falls short of less expensive options</strong></h2><p> As we’ve already emphasized, it’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP. You can find a number of sound cards for significantly less that provide competitive performance, though they generally don’t offer the same robust software package as the ZxR.</p><p> For a fraction of the price ($99 MSRP), you could get your hands on the Schitt Audio Fulla, an external DAC&#x2F;AMP set that covers 16 to 300 ohm headphones with plenty of power and has a clean, no-nonsense design. While it doesn’t offer the level of software support as the ZxR (those who want to dive deep into live microphone sound manipulation may not find what they need), for the consumer looking to delve into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hi-res-audio-4134630" >Hi-Fi audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this is an excellent deal.</p><p> At the $215 mark, still well below the price of the ZxR, the EVGA Nu audio card performs as well as external DAC&#x2F;AMPs in the $1,000 range. It also has minimalist software which Sound Blaster devotees may find a little feature-light, but even given the dearth of software options the EVGA Nu is the clear winner.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/evga-nu-audio-card-review-4769828" >EVGA Nu Audio Card Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> For about $160, the Asus Strix Raid PRO delivers better audio than the Sound Blaster ZxR and a control module that’s more useful than the ACM. The Strix’s “control box” has a button to turn EQ presets on and off, to change output between headphones and speakers, and all the features of the ACM (save 6.3mm jacks). The EQ button, which Asus calls the Raid button, is especially useful for gamers to switch between modes in-game.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-strix-raid-pro-review-4769832" >ASUS Strix Raid PRO Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good card that’s showing its age.</strong></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR is a quality, expensive sound card, with comprehensive software features and the hardware to power great consumer headsets and microphones. The ZxR sounds good, and gamers will not be disappointed by the ZxR’s power, but audio purists and 7.1 surround fans can find cleaner performance with fewer bells and whistles for the $250 asking price of the ZxR.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Indoor TV antennas, like the AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna, can provide you with free broadcast TV channels. Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels.

The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/MacBook_Pro_lyrx-withsinger-tv.png"                      border="0"                >LYRX is an easy-to-use karaoke software with the professional features karaoke hosts need to perform with precision.

The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low.

For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason. This camera doesn’t come close to delivering what it promises, meaning it’s not worth even the trifle you’d pay for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  USB 2.0 12 Megapixel</li><li>Product Brand  Docooler</li><li>UPC  B00OB883F6</li><li>Price  $8.00</li><li>Weight  2.5 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.75 x 1.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Color  Transparent, blue, black</li><li>Connections  USB 2.0 A cord 56.25” long</li><li>Aperture  F&#x2F;2 -

channel</li><li>No USB ports</li></ul><p> TP-Link has built a reputation for itself recently with some surprisingly affordable Wi-Fi 6 routers, and the Deco X20 is no exception. This small but mighty mesh system represents a way to get into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without emptying your wallet.</p><p> The X20 is a good choice for users who need broad coverage, with three units handling homes of up to 5,800 square feet. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 support offers a comfortable 1.8Mbps bandwidth, although this is only partially on par with some of the pricier alternatives in this list.</p><p> But more importantly, the Deco X20 lacks the dedicated backhaul channel on more advanced mesh Wi-Fi systems. This means it may not perform as well on busy and heavily congested home networks — those with a dozen or more devices gaming, video calling, and streaming in 4K—but it should be more than enough for the online needs of smaller families.</p><p> The Deco X20 is a breeze to set up, thanks to TP-Link’s aptly named Deco app, which can help even the most inexperienced home networking users get up and running within a few minutes. It also includes TP-Link’s new HomeCare security suite, powered by Trend Micro. It offers anti-malware features and parental controls to keep your home network safe against intruders and kids away from the internet’s darker corners. Each unit includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect non-wireless devices, but sadly, there aren’t any USB ports for sharing external storage devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> HomeCare, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX1800 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><h2 id="Best-Parental-Controls"><a href="#Best-Parental-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Best Parental Controls"></a>Best Parental Controls</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >Netgear Orbi Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e0pqAK3I9BIPd_HjQl8z5DRaZ-I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-orbi-whole-home-wi-fi-system-41457ad2356b431eb21ef92d6fc06f7e.jpg" >Netgear Orbi Whole Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >$225 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast and reliable coverage</li><li>Easy to set up</li><li>Highly configurable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>USB ports don’t support shared storage</li></ul><p> Netgear’s Orbi strikes an almost perfect balance of performance, price, and features among mesh Wi-Fi systems. With only two units, Orbi can provide fast and stable Wi-Fi over an area of up to 5,000 square feet, and this range can be easily extended by adding additional units.</p><p> Netgear promises that Orbi can deliver at least 150Mbps anywhere in your home, which was more than evident in our testing. You’ll enjoy smooth online performance throughout your living space without worrying about buffering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830" >Netflix 4K UHD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> streams or stuttering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476" >Zoom calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Orbi accomplishes this by dedicating the fastest of its three Wi-Fi bands as a backhaul channel. Remember that in a mesh network, data to or from your device may pass from one access point to the following multiple times before it reaches your router and moves on to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924" >Internet Service Provider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network. The backhaul channel provides dedicated bandwidth for this pass-through traffic, ensuring you’ll get the same excellent wireless performance whether your devices are closer to the central unit or one of the satellite units.</p><p> This also makes the collection of four Gigabit Ethernet ports found on each unit even more helpful, as you can plug in things like a TV and not see a drop in speed. Each also has a USB 2.0 port for sharing printers around your home.

The MX 12600 bundle includes three identical Wi-Fi 6 capable AX4200 mesh units (three times 4,200 is 12,600, see?) for less than most other systems charge for only two. This means solid and reliable performance for homes of up to 8,100 square feet at an affordable price.</p><p> You’ll designate one of these units as the primary router that hosts your broadband connection, then place the other two wherever you need the best and strongest coverage in your home. The Velop system also features a “dynamic” backhaul channel: The system intelligently decides which of the three Wi-Fi bands is best suited to move traffic between the mesh stations and which should be available for your Wi-Fi clients.</p><p> Each unit also includes four Gigabit Ethernet ports, letting you hardwire in non-Wi-Fi devices. And thanks to a high-speed USB 3.2 port on the back of each unit, you can connect multiple hard drives or other storage devices for sharing files or even streaming media.</p><p> Linksys’ mobile app also makes the system a cinch to set up, walking you through getting the first unit online and then joining the other two into a single mesh network. Although you’ll need to use the mobile app for the initial configuration, you can manage the system from the more familiar web interface once the mesh has been configured.</p><p> The MX12600 system offers all the basic networking features you’d expect from a modern router, including elementary Quality of Service (QoS) support (which prioritizes devices based on the type of service they’re using. There are rudimentary parental controls, but they should be enough for most typical users.

Since a two-unit system will give you 5,000 square feet of Wi-Fi coverage (which can be expanded by adding up to five more satellite units), you’ll be sure to see consistently fast speeds anywhere in your home.</p><p> Netgear has also packed in four Gigabit Ethernet ports on each station, so you’ll have plenty of room for wiring in devices like game consoles for maximum performance. The main router on this higher-end model also offers a high-speed 2.5Gbps<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383" >Wide Area Network (WAN) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port to ensure you’re ready for the fastest home broadband connections.</p><p> One disappointing aspect of Netgear’s newer Wi-Fi 6 solution is the omission of the USB ports found in earlier Orbi versions. The lack of advanced configuration settings may also let power users down compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers. But if you want to maintain the best performance possible, even if it means sacrificing some network management features, this is the mesh system for you.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX6000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cjLjOjMRWQJm5An87vAXSv1ZALw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearOrbiAX6000-01f5a284913b44099978b706c3a3fa79.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi AX6000"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/orbi-whole-home-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-review-5069596" >Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u36wLJKd2jTPAgvkVuGxo2A8P4g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-zenwifi-xt8-ax6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-3865cd2d845349a78c533b0b397df43b.jpg" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 AX6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >$282 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/447452455" >$282 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1541979-REG/asus%5Fxt8%5Fb%5F2%5Fpk%5Fzenwifi%5Fac%5Fwhole%5Fhome%5Ftri%5Fband.html" >$350 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of advanced features</li><li>Parental and security controls</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul><p> Although Asus’ AiMesh technology will let you join almost any combination of Asus routers to form a mesh network, the company’s ZenWiFi XT8 takes that further.

The Asus mobile app makes it so easy to set up you won’t even notice how much power it packs under the hood.</p><p> The ZenWifi XT8 offers cutting-edge 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 technology and packs many gaming enhancements that have become synonymous with Asus routers.

And if you need to wire in devices at the points, you’ll want to look elsewhere.</p><p> Additionally, the Nest doesn’t support the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard like some of the other systems here, so if you need maximum performance or are a stickler for future-proofing your network, the Nest may not be the best option.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC2200 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O_4HqL-cj7KOoa_JTrVN--P752o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleNestWi-Fi-9704c0e2a822442d89253e49f44d9948.jpg"                      alt="Google Nest Wi-Fi"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-nest-wi-fi-review-4846243" >Google Nest Wi-Fi Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >Linksys Velop AC6600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/j4p01isOS24wSYnZhkkDN75cgIU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ac6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-system-c5531ec228e247eb88bb7d05247c3842.jpg" >Linksys Velop AC6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >$170 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/55384671" >$170 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcrichard.com/linksys-velop-whole-home-mesh-wi-fi-system-3-pack/WHW0303.html?slpfid=3" >View on Pcrichard.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Strong, consistent connection</li><li>Sleek Design</li><li>Great range</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some basic settings</li><li>Some features cost extra</li></ul><p> Linksys’ first whole home Wi-Fi system, the Velop Tri-Band AC6600, is one of the more attractive designs we’ve seen. Each sleek white node is roughly the size of a tower of Jenga blocks, and they look nice enough to sit on display rather than being hidden away. Linksys sells Velop nodes individually or in packs of two or three; each will give you about 2,000 square feet of coverage. So, a complete system can blanket a 6,000-square-foot home.</p><p> The Velop AC6600 system includes tri-band Wi-Fi and dedicates the second 5GHz band as a backhaul channel. This means it can keep traffic moving smoothly between all units for maximum performance throughout your home, even if one is under heavy usage. The downside is that your devices won’t be able to take advantage of the extra 5GHz band, so even though each of these AC2200 routers can theoretically provide 2,134Mbps of throughput, only 1,267Mbps of that total is available to your devices.</p><p> The Velop offers a simplified setup process thanks to the Linksys smartphone app. However, if you like to tinker with your network settings, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere since it has limited configuration options. There’s also no malware protection, and parental controls are confined to blocking websites and manually restricting internet access from specific devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SkmNvOHzz4u2QHpClMEbMhzcBbQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LinksysVelopAC6600-2fd0f211926949cd9e38646f533fb981-6b8bc5f3009346dfaee7ef6b86357f34.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop AC6600"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/linksys-velop-review-powerful-mesh-router-5072402" >Linksys Velop Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network"></a>What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network</h2><p> Every wireless router, no matter how many antennas it has or how powerful it is, suffers from the same issue: radio signals weaken when they pass through walls, floors, and other obstructions. Mesh Wi-Fi network systems are designed to solve this problem by placing a number of nodes throughout your home or business, creating a uniformly strong signal with no dead spots.</p><p> Unlike traditional routers with wireless extenders and access points, mesh systems are designed from the ground up to work as a node-based system. Setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network system is typically a lot easier than connecting range extenders to an existing system, and they automatically pass your connection from one node to the next as you move around your home.</p><p> The main drawback of mesh Wi-Fi network systems is the price, as they tend to be more expensive than traditional routers. You can typically buy a nice router and some extenders for less than a mesh Wi-Fi starter kit, but if your situation really calls for a mesh system, it’s well worth the additional investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFk9VbnycX8txbFO35hsBW2ZGvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-2_1-5c8fbca346e0fb000172f07e.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use"><a href="#Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?"></a>Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?</h3><p> Most mesh Wi-Fi network systems support a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-connected-home-817684" >smart home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> integration system, and a few support more than one.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the most commonly supported, with integration from manufacturers like Eero, Linksys, Netgear, and more. Philips Hue,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ifttt-4172417" >IFTTT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and others see less integration.</p><p> If you already have some smart devices in your home, and you’re already tied into either the Alexa or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-home-and-how-does-it-work-4801919" >Google Home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ecosystem, then that should inform your decision regarding which mesh Wi-Fi network system to choose, but keep in mind that you don’t technically need your router to support your smart home assistant unless you need to be able to control its features with voice commands, such as enabling your guest network or blocking access to your kids’ devices.</p><p> If you’re an Apple HomeKit user, then the iPhone maker has taken a different approach. You won’t find any routers that can be controlled via Siri, however, a few mesh systems are adding HomeKit-specific security features to keep your smart home devices protected from network intrusions, which is something that neither Google Home nor Amazon Alexa yet offers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs"><a href="#Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs"></a>Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs</h3><p> Since mesh systems are high-end equipment, they typically include robust security options and parental controls. There are a handful of systems that don’t include either, so look for those if you don’t have kids and prefer to manage security on individual devices.</p><p> The most important thing to check in this area is whether or not the security and parental controls of the mesh system you’re interested in require a subscription. Basic security options are often free, but the best-advanced protections and parental controls often come at the cost of an ongoing monthly subscription, so make sure to take that into account.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi extender?<br> Mesh Wi-Fi systems and Wi-Fi extenders extend the reach of your wireless signal beyond your main router’s range. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are more tightly integrated, with the main and satellite devices expressly designed to work in concert.</li><li>Are mesh Wi-Fi systems faster?<br> Technically speaking, a mesh Wi-Fi system won’t offer better performance than an equivalent standalone router when you’re sitting right beside it. Since speed always falls off due to a weaker signal as you move farther away from your router, mesh systems can make a difference in larger homes.</li><li>Do you need to replace your existing router?<br> In most cases, the answer is yes. Although some mesh Wi-Fi systems can work with existing routers, you’ll generally get better performance and a much better user experience if you use a full mesh Wi-Fi system. If you’re a cable internet subscriber, you’ll still need to hang onto your cable modem.</li><li>How fast is a mesh Wi-Fi system?<br> Since mesh Wi-Fi network systems are uniformly high-end, they are also pretty fast. If your home internet connection isn’t very fast, then there isn’t any benefit to choosing a speedier mesh system over a slower one. You can check your internet connection speed with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-test-sites-2626177" >free speed tests <i class="fa-regular

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market.

Keep reading for their full take.</em></p><p> The promise of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the ultimate RPGs, a game that draws you into a complex, interwoven, living digital world where your decisions truly matter. In the eight years since its development was announced, an immense amount of anticipation has built up around this game, fueled by sky-high promises and too-good-to-be-true teasers. Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077, like Spore and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/no-mans-sky-tips-4117336" >No Man’s Sky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before it, falls short of the hype built up around it.</p><p> Look a little closer, and you may find a lot to love in this game, but it’s important to be aware of Cyberpunk 2077’s many flaws before deciding to jump into the immense and darkly beautiful dystopian metropolis that is Night City.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YQBwL9wFHphVzIqJYlYwd0J2OYU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-2-7e358ac09a2c48fbb0f6aaec1e9381e9.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Story-Engaging-and-well-written"><a href="#Story-Engaging-and-well-written" class="headerlink" title="Story: Engaging and well written"></a>Story: Engaging and well written</h2><p> You start out by choosing from one of several different life paths, each of which features a different intro, as well as unique dialogue options throughout the game. The Nomad starts in the wastelands, the Street Kid in the inner city, and the Corpo in what else but the heart of a mega corporation.</p><p> Once you get past the prologue you are let loose upon Night City, and from here the game progresses through various interconnected missions, both mandatory and optional. Because of this interconnected nature of the game, you may get a different outcome to the overarching story based on your decisions, both in main story missions and side quests. It can be rather daunting to be faced with so many potentially impactful decisions, and between this and the dense skill and ability customization system, this is one instance in which you might want to invest in a physical guide to the game.</p><p> As for the quality of the story itself, whatever path you choose is remarkably well written, and this quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity. It is well-acted, and some sequences are so well done that you can almost forget you’re playing a game, and it becomes more like an interactive movie. This is in part due to the innovative conversation system, which allows the player more agency while talking to NPCs. Unlike a lot of games, most conversations don’t lock you in and fix you in place until you excuse yourself, and it’s remarkable how natural it feels to talk to people in the game.</p><p> There is clearly a lot more polish put on the main story missions than on some other parts of the game, and if you follow it closely, the flaws of Cyberpunk 2077 don’t show quite so much. You get to experience the massive open world of Night City in a way that makes narrative sense and see the most exciting set-piece sequences. With that said, there are some really entertaining side stories to be found if you venture off the straight and narrow path of the main campaign.</p><p> Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed"></a>Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed</h2><p> As with the game as a whole, Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows. It does some things very well and stumbles bafflingly in other regards. The game mostly takes place in the first person, with third-person view being an option while driving.</p><p> Driving is not what I’d call a perfect experience in either third or first-person modes. Though beautifully designed and widely varied, vehicles tend to have little weight to them, and you really have to work to avoid careening about the road, running over pedestrians, and attracting the tepid attention of the police. They all also seem to be in desperate need of a new set of brakes, and to make matters worse the AI for the NPC vehicles is very simple indeed. Park your car with a bit of it sticking out into the road and a line will quickly build up as these simpletons exhibit infinite patience rather than simply go around.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NwK7qVv8XDmr_i0b9XzULnmPZ9Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-5-664cae2e38304560a7d6fc3ce2a84335.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The reason behind the driving issues seems to be largely an issue of perception, as they occur at high speeds, but unless you keep an eye on your speedometer it’s very difficult to judge how fast you’re going. I often found myself going over a hundred, but my mind said I was traveling at half that or less. It would be better for the sake of gameplay if your wheels stuck to the asphalt a bit better, and it wouldn’t really be that unrealistic, given that it is 2077 after all; it makes sense for cars to handle better than they do in 2020.</p><p> What can’t be explained away by an unwise dedication to realism is the behavior of NPCs. This simplicity of NPC AI is widespread throughout the game and a big letdown from what was promised. When I started out, I played very carefully, since the realistic looks and the promise of police response encouraged me to treat everyone with respect, like I was in a real living world. However, as time went on I came to view these automatons with even less consideration than the NPCs in other RPGs.</p><p> Their glitchy reactions are so at odds with their realistic looks that the end result is rather off-putting, so I began to regard them with pure disdain. Also, the fear of police response quickly fades once you realize that they won’t chase you for more than half a block, and once they lose sight of you they forget about you completely in short order. There are no consequences, no exciting spontaneous chase scenes, just a couple of dudes firing at you ineffectually with pistols.</p><p> Furthermore, there are no lasting consequences. Your friendly contact in the NCPD will still call you up and ask for help, and cops on the street won’t care that the world’s most prolific mass murderer just waltzed through the holographic police tape cordoning off their crime scene. By hour 15, the result of this failure of AI systems led to me to think nothing of stealing a car from the middle of a busy intersection and accidentally pinwheeling my out of control vehicle through a crowd of pedestrians before driving off into the sunset as two officers bounced rounds off my retreating bumper.</p><p> If you want to avoid conflict and don’t want to slow down for stupid drivers, your best bet is a motorcycle, and it is indeed a blast to go zipping through the streets dodging through gaps in traffic. For some reason, motorcycles control much more reliably than cars, and a cynical mind might suppose that more care was put into motorcycle control due to Cyberpunk featuring the brand of motorcycle owned by a major celebrity who plays a part in the game’s story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ByBdwophc_bSfdD-P0CfbqJgbwY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-7-e6be7e2c1ae24ac3a1c5dbfd4a5b595a.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> You can also use fast travel booths to get around instantly once you’ve unlocked them, though I found myself favoring the slow route, despite the issues inherent in that experience. Cruising through Night City is truly a jaw-dropping experience.</p><p> This contrast of “holy cow” moments with irritating design flaws continues with combat. In one of the first combat encounters of the game, you fight a dynamic battle in a small apartment that includes walls being ripped apart by gunfire. In another sequence, you fight a crazy cyborg with swords for arms as you race down the freeway. These scripted fights in the story are exciting and well-balanced.</p><p> However, stray from the areas of the world where your story is progressing, and you will meet higher-level enemies. They do more damage and have more strength, and also drop gear that you can’t equip until you level up. This makes sense on a technical level as it prevents the story missions from becoming imbalanced and too easy. The problem is that the enemies look little different from those you’ve fought in lower-level locations, and it really shatters immersion for a random thug with no armor or magic powers to take a dozen sniper rifle bullets to the head to kill. Again, this makes sense from a balancing perspective, but they could have figured out a more dynamic and natural way to scale difficulty throughout the game.</p><p> Other aspects of gameplay include hacking or netrunning as it is referred to in the game. This allows you to take control of various objects and even people, depending on your character build. It’s immensely helpful in tough fights to enter scanning mode, appraise the situation, and use your hacking skills to turn the tide of battle. With hacking, stealth skills, and non-lethal weaponry you can even go for no-kill run, though bugs, glitches, and AI issues may make the temptation to jump in, guns blazing, rather tempting.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs. Driving through Night City is still exciting after dozens of hours, and I’m still finding new weapons that offer new ways to approach combat.</p><p> Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><h2 id="Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with"><a href="#Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots to tinker with"></a>Customization: Lots to tinker with</h2><p> There is a deep level of character customization possible in Cyberpunk 2077, and you can sink a lot of time into creating the perfect character. Of course, you can always just pick a preset, but where’s the fun in that? I tried to craft a likeness of Snake Plissken from Escape from Los Angeles, but couldn’t get it quite right, so I made a rough approximation of Basil Fawlty instead.</p><p> Next, you get seven points with which to customize your character’s attributes between body, intelligence, technical ability, and cool. This determines your proficiency in both physical and technical skills. Don’t worry too much, as you will level up and add to these attributes and their associated skills as the game progresses. Skills allow you to fine-tune your abilities, as well as add new ones to your arsenal. It’s a good idea to focus on a specialty, once you know what you enjoy doing in the game because the more points you put into a category the more options unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Uqy4AEm6VMUR3LFH9U2FK5UDvo0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-3-28901c5bd3564eeea8e98bc9dbb8ae07.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> Another area of customization is your cybernetic implants. These can affect everything from your netrunning skills to giving you swords and rocket launchers that pop out of your arms. You’ll need to visit a Ripperdoc to buy and install them, and they cost a pretty penny, so you’ll need to pull off a few jobs to afford them.</p><p> You can also clothe your character in whatever garments you find or buy around the game world. These affect your armor and other stats, though in a somewhat unintuitive fashion where a high-level cotton shirt may give you more armor than a low-level bulletproof vest. This goes for weapons as well, and I ended up going through weapons at a rapid pace as I acquired higher level ones.</p><p> Of course, if you get a weapon you can’t bear to part with you can upgrade it, and you will pick up legendary and epic gear that you will want to hold onto (including clothing). However, I found it to be a bit of a headache figuring out the crafting system, and you need to invest points in the necessary skills to do so.</p><p>At launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City"><a href="#Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City" class="headerlink" title="Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City"></a>Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City</h2><p> At launch Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess. Even a few months and a few patches later it’s very noticeably in need of major fixes. Right out of the gate I found a collectible card that can only be picked up during the intro, but the game refused to allow me to pick it up, so I was forced to leave it sitting there forlornly, forever gnawing at the completionist streak in me.</p><p> It bothered me even though I later found it wasn’t actually unique or important. Just after this, I drove past a dingy alley and glimpsed trash bags flying up into the air from the dumpster. Curious if it was some cyber-raccoon I investigated, but to no avail. It was only silent, motionless bags of trash, quietly minding their own business.</p><p> More game-breaking bugs lay deeper in the game. In one mission I entered a shooting competition, but the mission broke halfway through and locked me in the shooting range. Worse was a bug that rendered me unable to draw my weapons, and this persisted even after loading an earlier save. I ran aimlessly through the streets spamming the alt key until I injured a pedestrian with a car and got a warrant put out for my arrest. When this happened the screen flickered, and suddenly I was clutching an assault rifle. I felt like Ralphie from “A Christmas Story” opening up his Red Rider BB gun.</p><p> Other bugs I ran into included many instances of cars being fused together or spontaneously combusting. One particularly disturbing scene during a mission involved me materializing inside an NPC behind the wheel of a car so that I was staring in horror at the backs of her eyeballs, her detached jaw hanging in mid-air as hair floated like tentacles all about me.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JM3cD1pX6maee1yiQYZnSgc-9pw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-4-624da4fa8225434eb59ba999a53dafd6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries"><a href="#Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Mature content: Pushing the boundaries"></a>Mature content: Pushing the boundaries</h2><p> It must be mentioned that Cyberpunk 2077 earns its mature rating. Parents and players alike would do well to head the descriptors of that rating, as all of them are well deserved. There are options to ameliorate this in some respects, but only to a limited extent. The fact is that Cyberpunk 2077 is an imagining of a dark and disturbing future, and the game forces players to confront the consequences should humanity go down such a road.</p><p> The truth is that Cyberpunk is a role-playing game in the truest sense of the word. While you will never be able to completely dodge potentially offensive content, you can play the game in a way that reflects your own morality and ideals. A great example of this potential for choice is alcohol, which you will be proffered on numerous occasions throughout the game. Even though it is embedded into the story you almost always have the option to refuse, though as in real life the peer pressure is there and the choice may affect how people regard you.</p><p> The high quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity.</p><h2 id="Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry"><a href="#Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Making strong GPUs cry"></a>Performance: Making strong GPUs cry</h2><p> Sometimes a game comes along that pushes the limits of what computer hardware is possible. This led to a whole generation of gamers growing up asking the classic question “Can it run Crysis?”. Cyberpunk 2077 is truly the Crysis of the modern day, and that means that at launch very few people will get to experience this game as intended. To get the most out of this game you really need a Nvidia RTX 3080, an expensive GPU that at the time of this writing is so scarce that really only a handful of people around the globe are getting the most out of Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p> With that said, don’t give up hope. PC gamers with last-gen GPUs can still eke out a good experience from this monster of a game. My rig made out pretty well with its RTX 2070, though it took a lot of time tweaking graphics options in order to balance looks with performance.</p><p> Running at 1080p I was able to max out many of the graphics options, though I had to make a few sacrifices. Interestingly, the infamously power-hungry ray tracing tech actually greatly improves performance here if your GPU is capable of it, this is thanks to the integration of DLSS which works with ray tracing to reduce the load on your GPU. You do trade a good deal of sharpness for this DLSS performance boost, but honestly, I find the grainy look to be appropriate for the grimy dystopia depicted in the game.</p><p> Even with my settings well-adjusted I still ran into occasional frame rate drops, particularly in areas with a lot of volumetric fog and many lighting sources. Traveling at high speeds also tested the limits of my gaming rig.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/toUXDFSRFZjol-BOgnhnVEyJTYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-8-7b54b824c3bc4dcfb04234f69204d2f6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> If you don’t have a ray tracing enabled card, you may want to think twice about Cyberpunk 2077 until you’re able to upgrade.

The same goes for last-gen consoles (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), where the experience is also greatly impacted by reduced processing power.

Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs.</p><p> Everything is so finely detailed, from the lovingly rendered cars to the buildings to the cracked and filthy pavement beneath your feet it is incredible what CDPR has achieved here. Because of how sprawling, spectacular, and densely packed the game is, you can often put aside momentarily the game’s flaws and just admire the sheer scale of it all. Automotive enthusiasts will fall in love with the retro-futuristic design of cars in the game, though unfortunately, car customization is a feature that was pulled before release.</p><p> Character models are also remarkably lifelike, and when conversing with characters in the game it is amazing how little of the nefarious uncanny valley is present in them. However, as previously mentioned, I found that the realistic design of NPCs on the street clashes with their awful AI in a way that brings about an all new but no less awful incarnation of the uncanny valley. This isn’t a critique of the graphics so much as a mark against the buggy and incomplete state of the game.</p><p> One other criticism I have is not a slight against the graphics and is largely a matter of personal preference, but I can’t help but feel somewhat put off by the oppressive dystopian setting after putting many hours into the game. If anything, this is high praise for its realism, as CDPR has managed to realistically depict a dark future that is at times too real for comfort. It’s so grand in its decadent squalor that I can’t help be drawn back in.</p><p> One more thing that irritated me was the repetition of items and advertisements throughout the world. The many glowing holographic and neon advertisements seem to have maybe a dozen or so variations at most and are all rather unpleasant to look at. It’s just a little weird that the developers didn’t design a few more ads given how much unique handcrafted detail is in the rest of the game world.</p><p> Again, it’s important to note that most players won’t see this spectacular vision of Night City due to the demanding hardware requirements, and that is a shame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/o42yZx4igr8SBsJoS2Nc52n6m3U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-6-1b41a87ba1244122adf280147c09e5f1.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Multiplayer-Absent-for-the-moment"><a href="#Multiplayer-Absent-for-the-moment" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Absent for the moment"></a>Multiplayer: Absent for the moment</h2><p> At launch and for long after Cyberpunk 2077 will be a single-player game. However, CDPR has said that a few years down the road they will be launching a multiplayer mode, and a lot of people are looking forward to that. Of course, it is impossible to predict if this will be any good or if some circumstances might prevent its release, but there is a lot of potential for Cyberpunk to become a better experience when Night City goes online. With that said, CDPR really needs to fix the single-player game before they even think about launching multiplayer.</p><h2 id="Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions"><a href="#Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions"></a>Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions</h2><p> At $60 with no extra monetization at launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bargain. Take this with a grain of salt though, as this situation could change dramatically once the multiplayer mode is released.</p><h2 id="Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla"><a href="#Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla" class="headerlink" title="Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla"></a>Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</h2><p> Though very different in setting, tone, and gameplay perspective,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a similarly vast open-world that launched not long before Cyberpunk 2077, and gamers may be split on which to dump a hundred or more hours of time into. At the time of writing, Valhalla is a much more polished and complete experience. Also, whereas the dystopia of Night City can be an oppressive environment to spend many hours exploring, the green hills of England in Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla offer an escapist experience.</p><p> It’s also impossible to avoid comparisons to<a class="link"   href="https://www.liveabout.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-cheats-3406136" >Grand Theft Auto <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which in many ways Cyberpunk 2077 bears more than a superficial resemblance to. When you get right down to it, Cyberpunk plays like a heavily modded GTA V with less humor, more bugs, and worse driving mechanics.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An open-world RPG with enormous potential that’s sadly incomplete and unpolished.</strong></p><p> Cyberpunk 2077 had enormous potential, but it launched long before it was complete and the result is a deeply conflicting experience. Game-breaking bugs, performance issues, missing features, and demanding hardware requirements make it difficult to recommend, but there is the core of something great lying within. There are hundreds of hours of content to enjoy if you can temper your expectations and employ a saintly degree of patience.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Cyberpunk 2077</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  December 2020</li><li>Color  N&#x2F;A</li><li>Platforms  PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Stadia</li><li>Rating  M</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-creating-a-memorable-podcast-niche-top-ai-name-generators/"><u>[New] Creating a Memorable Podcast Niche – Top AI Name Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-tubes-the-ultimate-video-share-sites-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beyond Tubes  The Ultimate Video Share Sites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-decoding-revenue-how-much-do-creators-earn-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Decoding Revenue  How Much Do Creators Earn on Youtube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-in-depth-assessment-lightroom-app-android-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  In-Depth Assessment  Lightroom App, Android Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-animators-toolkit-windows-movie-maker-for-winning-projects/"><u>2024 Approved  The Animator's Toolkit  Windows Movie Maker for Winning Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-closer-look-at-minecrafts-campfire-legends-outfit-series-expert-review-and-insights/"><u>A Closer Look at Minecraft's Campfire Legends Outfit Series: Expert Review and Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/advanced-techniques-for-sharper-screen-collaboration/"><u>Advanced Techniques for Sharper Screen Collaboration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-apeman-c450-dashcam-assessment-top-picks-for-economical-drivers/"><u>Affordable Apeman C450 Dashcam Assessment – Top Picks for Economical Drivers!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-audio-adventure-oneplus-buds-reviewed/"><u>Affordable Audio Adventure: OnePlus Buds Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-innovation-or-confusing-choice-the-microsoft-surface-go-examined/"><u>Affordable Innovation or Confusing Choice?

Intentionally stylized black and gold packaging, which resembles the retro feel of the 1980s Game &amp; Watch classic titles, is a familiar and warm return to an era.</p><p> From the moment you pick up and pop open the box, the design oozes old-school cool and nostalgia.</p><p> Combined with the slender and sleek design of the console itself, which features a plastic gold and red case, it’s both beautiful and surprisingly sturdy for a device so small. We do wish that Nintendo hadn’t nixed the classic kick-stand feature, which this Game &amp; Watch product, unlike its collectible predecessors, sorely lacks.</p><p> The screen itself is tiny, measuring barely over two inches in length, but the bright LCD screen makes it easy to see Mario or Luigi clearly while playing. While the controls are a bit small, it’s not wholly unexpected for a Nintendo Game &amp; Watch product.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RGM_gLdIp2jvsVG5LhRKLVw0nho=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo_GameWatch_04-f94be735a5644020b52656e67a6c0465.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros."                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> Nintendo Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros. arrives in a small package that is lovingly designed in the Game &amp; Watch family feel.

Simply open the box and remove the console from its shipment packaging, press the power button on the right-hand side, click the Time button to set your clock for the included Watch mode, and then you’re all set to enjoy the preloaded Super Mario Bros_._ and Ball games.

Also included are 35 hidden interactions, which make the standard Watch mode a joy as well.</p><p> As with the original Super Mario Bros_._ release, playing on the Game &amp; Watch is a challenge, but a welcome one at that as it captures the difficulty of the original title! With single and multiplayer modes available, there’s plenty of fun to go around. Choose from Mario or Luigi as you make your way across the world, crushing Goombas and Koopa Troopas as you go. I do appreciate that it’s possible to pause the game, so you never lose progress in a pinch.</p><p> The Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros. is preloaded with Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 (also known, The Lost Levels), and Ball_,_ the foremost title in the Game &amp; Watch series.</p><p> The Ball game is the only included Game &amp; Watch title in the product. Balls bounce back and forth in the air as you juggle them to keep them from hitting the ground. Instead of the classic Ball character design, Mario’s head has been superimposed on the character. It’s a much simpler game, and it’s OK, but this game loses its allure fairly quickly due to the repetitive gameplay.</p><h2 id="Audio-Surprisingly-loud-and-crisp"><a href="#Audio-Surprisingly-loud-and-crisp" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Surprisingly loud and crisp"></a>Audio: Surprisingly loud and crisp</h2><p> The included mono speaker is surprisingly loud and crisp, emitting 8-bit chiptunes.

The appeal of the Nintendo Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros. edition is that it’s a nostalgic, collectible, and fun handheld gaming device that’s a throwback to an older era of gaming. From the black and gold box design, the red and gold retro frame, and even the titles chosen, its inception is meant to celebrate the long-running success of the Nintendo family.</p><p> Sure, we could compare Nintendo Game &amp; Watch to Nintendo’s current flagship, the Switch, PlayStation’s latest and greatest release, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —but, frankly, that would be unfair to the Game &amp; Watch. It simply isn’t meant to compete against these significantly more advanced consoles so much as complement Nintendo’s current properties and bring the joy of classics to a whole new generation.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A nostalgic throwback that collectors and gamers will love.</strong></p><p> The Nintendo Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros. is a throwback to an older, simpler era of gaming that packs a wallop of a punch, bringing the challenge of the original Super Mario games and the original Game &amp; Watch Ball title while making them accessible to a whole new generation of players. While we do wish Nintendo had included additional titles—who doesn’t want_more_ classic options when these are so fun—it’s no showstopper for enjoying this product.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin

Read on for the full review.</em></p><p> Since I’m still working from home, I’ve been using a built-in desk in my bedroom. It left me hunched over all day, and I would feel my back aching by the time I logged off my work VPN. Even worse with this desk, I couldn’t adjust it. I needed something that would not only fit into my hundred-year-old home aesthetic but would allow me to shift and stretch my back when I needed to.</p><p> The Flexispot was the answer to everything I needed in my workspace: classy; modern; and completely adjustable.</p><p> Cue the Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk. The Flexispot was the answer to everything I needed in my workspace: classy; modern; and completely adjustable. After a week of testing, it’s safe to say I’ve never been so madly in love with a piece of furniture.</p><h2 id="Design-Mixing-the-old-with-the-new"><a href="#Design-Mixing-the-old-with-the-new" class="headerlink" title="Design: Mixing the old with the new"></a>Design: Mixing the old with the new</h2><p> This standing desk’s design and aesthetic gave me an executive feel when I set it up. First things first—it’s really heavy, clocking in at around 100 pounds if the packaging is to be believed. I can’t recommend handling the box by yourself, and, had I tried that myself, I would have probably been squished trying to haul it up two flights of stairs.</p><p> It’s this American design, along with rustic knobs on the sole drawer, that give it a timeless look that can complement any home.</p><p> The wooden veneer immediately caught my eye. Named after the famous Theodore Roosevelt, this desk incorporates a wooden walnut veneer to give its classic look. It’s this American design, along with rustic knobs on the sole drawer, that give it a timeless look that can complement any home. Even better were the two USB ports that were incorporated beside the buttons for raising and lowering the desk.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/du2Ec4SmWWkaWQQCKbMuR4NiBUo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FlexiSpot_StandingDesk_02-4a15245115084875b6ac05ba8f4c6a53.jpg"                      alt="Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-and-Usage-Adjustable-and-comfortable"><a href="#Performance-and-Usage-Adjustable-and-comfortable" class="headerlink" title="Performance and Usage: Adjustable and comfortable"></a>Performance and Usage: Adjustable and comfortable</h2><p> Once I set the desk up, I sat down and felt like a queen in my castle. Even at its lowest, the desk provided that ergonomic feel I desperately need in my home office setup. The two legs of the desk sit far enough back, and the desk is wide so I didn’t have to worry about kicking the legs accidentally. That said, I live in a house with cats that shed, and I noticed that the hair did stick and stand out on the metal.</p><p> That wasn’t the only place where I noticed minor cosmetic issues. Because the surface is made of veneer, every time I left a smudge on the desk, be it just general PC use or if I accidentally dropped a tortilla chip, it showed. Since it’s veneer, I could clean it up just as easily. If you’re wanting a desk that doesn’t look like it’s been used, this desk is not for you, but if you don’t mind gentling wiping down the desk every so often for cosmetic reasons, then it will be perfect for your home office needs.</p><p> Once I set the desk up, I sat down and felt like a queen in my castle.</p><p> The Theodore Standing Desk also turned out to be the perfect place to store my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jabra-talk-45-review-5070286#:~:text=A%20great%2C%20feature%2Dpacked%20Bluetooth,with%20its%20voice%20command%20features." >Jabra Talk 45 Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-rvf-arc-touch-mouse-review-4799143" >Microsoft RVF Arc Touch Mouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so I wouldn’t keep losing them around the house. The desk’s drawer is about three inches deep, so it could also easily store important papers. And, since the desk space is so large, I could easily fit two 17-inch laptops on there and have extra space to hold my cell phone, planner, and a desk lamp with room to spare.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/frfVa5g5ngg9vZAugmed_f2jsho=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FlexiSpot_StandingDesk_03-b929f6838e464f14ad5615d440449658.jpg"                      alt="Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Controls-Tap-a-button"><a href="#Controls-Tap-a-button" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Tap a button"></a>Controls: Tap a button</h2><p> If I got tired of sitting, usually with a cat on my lap, I could easily convert this into a standing desk thanks to two buttons that raise and lower the desk through motorized controls. While it was a little noisy, the noise doesn’t seem atypical for any standing desk models on the market. I stopped the desk when it rose to conform to my height of 5 feet, 8 inches, but the desk can go up to nearly 50 inches for people who need the extra height.</p><p> However, one of my biggest gripes about the controls is that sometimes the buttons didn’t register when I first pressed them. It isn’t a big deal, because I assume the desk is waking up from some kind of sleep mode, but sometimes it took pressing the button twice to raise or lower it. Personally, this wouldn’t deter me from investing in this because once it goes, it’s a smooth motion, giving you plenty of time to adjust any cords or move things around.</p><p> One of my biggest gripes about the controls is that sometimes the buttons didn’t register when I first pressed them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IfBuQB7ShOvw2XlkJal4eCb1myE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FlexiSpot_StandingDesk_04-1e85750d263e43f4815a4b1eeddf41a1.jpg"                      alt="Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Price-A-steal-at-the-price"><a href="#Price-A-steal-at-the-price" class="headerlink" title="Price: A steal at the price"></a>Price: A steal at the price</h2><p> At around $500, before desk accessories like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-standing-desk-mats-4155870" >standing desk mat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Flexispot Theodore is very reasonably priced. Keep in mind that you’re not paying for real wood, which factors into the price tag, but a wood veneer finish.

And, coming from personal experience using one, when it folds down, it’s usually still thick enough that it’s not flush with the desk, and that can cause ergonomic wrist issues, especially if you’re using a laptop or an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >ergonomic keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> While the Rain Design’s stand may look initially like the more optimal choice because you can keep your current home setup, the Flexispot Theodore comes with complete height adjustability, which is something that the Rain Design can’t really compete with, especially since the Rain is designed for laptops instead of a desktop. The Theodore Standing Desk takes this into account with its 99-pound weight limit. If you prefer to work with your current setup, then the Rain Design might be a better option for your space. However, if you want to have complete adjustability, then the FlexiSpot is the best option for your work-from-home needs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Simply amazing for working from home.</strong></p><p> The complete height adjustability and the complimentary USB ports on the Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk are perfect for any home that wants to retain a classic look while getting a major modern upgrade. With the small storage drawer, it’s the perfect standing desk to complete any home office.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cumuluspro-standing-desk-mat-review-4775314" >CumulusPRO Standing Desk Mat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ergodriven-topo-review-4775310" >Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ergohead-standing-desk-mat-review-4775317" >Ergohead Standing Desk Mat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Theodore Standing Desk</li><li>Product Brand  Flexispot</li><li>MPN  UD1B</li><li>Price  $500.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Product Dimensions  47.6 x 23.6 x 49.2 in.</li><li>Color  Walnut</li><li>Warranty  5-year limited warranty</li><li>Connectivity Options  USB port</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-deep-dive-into-youtube-writers-workshop-space/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  A Deep Dive Into YouTube’ Writers' Workshop Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-crafting-a-tiktok-twosome-film/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Crafting a TikTok Twosome Film</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-accelerate-your-video-content-creation/"><u>[New] Accelerate Your Video Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-sharpen-aesthetic-focus-learning-border-techniques-for-insta-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Sharpen Aesthetic Focus  Learning Border Techniques for Insta-Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-closer-look-at-apcs-be600m1-power-saver-exceptional-energy-storage-and-handy-usb-recharge-functionality/"><u>A Closer Look at APC's BE600M1 Power Saver: Exceptional Energy Storage & Handy USB Recharge Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/a-different-look-at-online-connectivity-metrics/"><u>A Different Look at Online Connectivity Metrics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/adventure-awaits-nikon-coolpix-p1000-zoom-revelation/"><u>Adventure Awaits: Nikon COOLPIX P1000 Zoom Revelation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/augmented-reality-excellence-mastering-the-use-of-spark-ar-luts-for-2024/"><u>Augmented Reality Excellence  Mastering the Use of Spark AR LUTs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/behind-the-curtain-the-hidden-costs-of-vr-for-2024/"><u>Behind the Curtain  The Hidden Costs of VR for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/boost-your-internet-reach-on-a-budget-the-tp-link-re200-ac750-range-extender-reviewed-thoroughly/"><u>Boost Your Internet Reach on a Budget: The TP-Link RE200 AC750 Range Extender Reviewed Thoroughly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-amazonbasics-flat-antenna-watching-free-television-effortlessly/"><u>Budget-Friendly AmazonBasics Flat Antenna: Watching Free Television Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/choosing-your-digital-postman-an-in-depth-look-at-outlookcom-vs-gmail/"><u>Choosing Your Digital Postman: An In-Depth Look at Outlook.com Vs.

Typically priced well below the competition while delivering strong core services and functionality, the Chrome OS-powered notebooks have become the affordable device of choice for many students, schools, and other budget-minded buyers.  </p><p> Launched in early 2017, the Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA) 12.5-inch laptop has been one of the most popular options, and more than two years later, it’s still on the market. Can this convertible laptop&#x2F;tablet hybrid really supplant ultraportable Windows and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Mac laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at a fraction of the price, or are the compromises too significant to overcome? We spent a week with the Chromebook Flip to see how it compares to today’s competition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3Q2pRvweVt3Gf6RfBaAwQ15QBag=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bottom_04-1508a99e93e94312a9477c6ec5c15022.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice"><a href="#Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice"></a><strong>Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice</strong></h2><p> Just as Chromebooks are conceptually designed as budget laptops, the Asus Chromebook Flip is physically built like a budget MacBook. It has the same kind of minimal aesthetic, albeit not to quite the same level of premium visual polish. From the hinge design to the materials and tiny nuances, the Chromebook Flip doesn’t look like a $1,000 laptop.</p><p> That’s not a complaint, just an observation. With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap. It feels like it’s built to deal with the daily stress of usage, but at a weight of just 2.65 pounds, it’s very light and easy to carry around. It does seem to attract dirt and smudges more than a lot of other aluminum laptops we’ve used, although it’s not difficult to rub them away.</p><p> The 12.5-inch touchscreen is a smidge smaller than the common 13-inch laptop screen size, but due to a lot of bezel around the display, the laptop’s overall size is nearly identical to an Apple MacBook Pro (albeit a little thicker). The excessive bezel and large Asus logo do signal the less high-end experience, however.</p><p> With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap.</p><p> Of course, as the name suggests, the Chromebook Flip does something that no MacBook can: it’s convertible, allowing you to fold the screen all the way back into a tablet form, or use a tent-like design to prop the device up and watch videos. The hinge feels sturdy in any position, thankfully, so you don’t have to worry about the tent falling flat, or the screen flopping around in any mode.</p><p> We’ve been using the Chromebook Flip in the tent mode to watch Twitch streams or YouTube playlists while washing dishes or making dinner, or having it run in the corner of a desk while doing other work. It’s super handy to have around as a portable, self-standing streaming display. And in the tablet format, with the screen fully folded back, it’s totally useful. It feels a bit odd to press your fingers against the keys while holding it, but don’t worry: they’re disabled in that form.</p><p> Like current MacBooks, the Chromebook Flip is all about USB-C ports; it puts one on each side and skips full-sized USB-A ports entirely. You can charge the laptop from either of those ports, and that versatility is appreciated. However, there’s also a microSD card port on the right, which is handy as the 64GB internal storage on this model is pretty slim (there are 32GB and 128GB versions available, as well), along with a 3.5mm headphone port on the left side.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip’s keyboard feels great in action. The one-piece chiclet keyboard has a scissor-style key design with 1.4mm of travel, which gives it a more satisfying feel than the latest MacBooks’ keys (which have very little travel), and the keys are responsive and not especially loud in usage. It’s also brightly backlit, which isn’t always the case with Chromebooks. The touchpad below is nicely sized and wider than some we’ve seen, although not nearly as large as Apple’s luxurious trackpads of late.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever"></a><strong>Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever</strong></h2><p> Setting up a Chromebook is incredibly easy. Just power it on (the button is on the left side), connect to a network, accept the terms of service and choose from any options that you’re prompted to, and then plug in your Google account info. If you do already have a Google account, then any bookmarks, Chrome extensions, and apps will automatically be added. If you don’t have a Google account, then you’ll need to sign up for one to use the Chromebook. In any case, this whole process shouldn’t take more than a matter of minutes to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AFQh-ERthm-g0pAMcnQlyA2Rjgw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bent_02-3dfd0720309d4d12beb5ae695a007aa1.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Display-Small-but-strong"><a href="#Display-Small-but-strong" class="headerlink" title="Display: Small, but strong"></a><strong>Display: Small, but strong</strong></h2><p> As mentioned, the Chromebook Flip’s 12.5-inch, 1080p screen is a little smaller than you’ll see on some rivals, but that doesn’t take away from its usability. It’s colorful and nicely vibrant, and text and graphics typically look crisp. It’s not one of the brightest screens we’ve seen, with a listed brightness of about 300 nits, but that’s pretty common amongst laptops. It’s a little dimmer than we’d like, admittedly. Visibility is impacted in direct sunlight, but in most situations, it’s hard to complain too much about this screen.</p><p> It also acts like an extra-large tablet screen since it’s a touchscreen with 10 points of interaction. It felt just as responsive as any tablet we’ve used.</p><h2 id="Performance-It-does-what-it-can"><a href="#Performance-It-does-what-it-can" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It does what it can"></a><strong>Performance: It does what it can</strong></h2><p> You really can’t pit the Chromebook Flip against pricier Windows and Mac laptops in terms of sheer processing power because Chromebooks aren’t built to be beasts. But they don’t really need to be: the highest quality of graphics processing it’ll need to handle are mobile-quality games, since the Chromebook Flip can run Android apps from the Play Store, and you’re not able to download high-end games from Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p><p> The version of the Chromebook Flip we tested came with a 2.2Ghz Intel Core M3-6Y30 chip, although you can get versions with a Core M7 or Pentium 4405Y chip for more power. Paired with 4GB RAM, we found the device to be plenty speedy getting around Chrome OS.</p><p> Compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p> Given the access to the Play Store, we benchmarked the Chromebook Flip using the same tests we use for Android phones, with a score of 8,818 on the PCMark 2.0 Work test. The Intel HD Graphics 515 integrated graphics, meanwhile, delivered a frame rate of 12 frames per second in the Car Chase demo and 53 frames per second in the T-Rex demo. Essentially, the Chromebook Flip seems comparable to an upper mid-range Android phone.</p><p> That comparison held up when playing Android racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, which ran at a pretty smooth clip but definitely looked fuzzier than usual thanks to being blown up for the larger screen. Online battle royale shooter PUBG Mobile also ran solidly, although the keyboard and trackpad combination didn’t feel right. We folded the screen back entirely and just used the touchscreen, which worked fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7B1-43v0GHPcS2HESabWT97_XPQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_Keyboard_03-8bc37c7c2d0243bb8ed1fa10e338374f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Audio-Sounds-fine"><a href="#Audio-Sounds-fine" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Sounds fine"></a><strong>Audio: Sounds fine</strong></h2><p> The tiny speaker grates on the left and right side of the Chromebook Flip don’t look too promising, but the playback quality was better than expected. Music output isn’t big and bold, but it’s pretty clear and it can get loud without getting too muddled. Video playback via YouTube and Netflix was sometimes too quiet at full volume, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-writer-free-word-processor-1x.3d9c80d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-No-complaints-here"><a href="#Network-No-complaints-here" class="headerlink" title="Network: No complaints here"></a><strong>Network: No complaints here</strong></h2><p> The Chromebook Flip has dual-band Wi-Fi that can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks, and we had no issues with either during our testing. We went online at a home network and a Starbucks Google network alike, and things were routinely speedy. On the home network, we saw speeds of about 33Mbps and upload speeds in excess of 10Mbps—essentially the same as we’ve seen with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >other laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth"><a href="#Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Nearly a day’s worth"></a><strong>Battery: Nearly a day’s worth</strong></h2><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life. The 39Wh battery cell is rated for up to 10 hours, and while that estimate is ambitious for everyday use, we typically saw seven or more hours of mixed usage with the screen at full brightness. That’s for our usual workflow of surfing the web, typing out documents, watching some YouTube videos, and streaming music from Spotify.</p><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life.</p><p> Our laptop video rundown test, which streams a Netflix movie over Wi-Fi while at 100 percent brightness, delivered a similar result: it lasted 6 hours, 57 minutes before the Chromebook Flip shut down. In both use cases, we were pleasantly surprised by the battery performance of the device—it even beat the 2018 MacBook Air.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VR5Y-1tDILHowNSeA408pnLVtgg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_closed_04-bde5ec8f988c4bb49e4019f95cc47c31.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

It’s a much simpler approach to PC usage, focusing only on essential features and functionality. The interface has a PC-like bar at the bottom, but it’s really more like an app dock on your phone or tablet. Unsurprisingly, the experience is built around Google’s own apps, coming preloaded with the Chrome web browser, Google Docs, YouTube, Google Photos, Google Maps, and more.</p><p> Since the Chromebook Flip’s original release, Google has added the ability to run Android apps downloaded from the Play Store. This is the same Play Store found on scads of smartphones and tablets the world over, offering access to a wide array of games and apps. Not every app looks or acts perfectly on a larger screen, but we mostly had success: business chat app Slack looked like the desktop version on PC and Mac, as did Spotify. Twitch’s interface just looked like it was stretched out from the phone app, but video still played perfectly.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department.</p><p> Anyone looking for a familiar PC or Mac experience, or a device that can run familiar PC and Mac apps and games, might struggle with using a Chromebook. It’s really meant for casual usage—things like web browsing, watching media, writing, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-lightweight-laptops-to-buy-4065134" >lightweight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> game playing. Need a device primed for high-end, professional creative software? Need something capable of playing the latest and greatest games? That’s not a Chromebook.</p><p> Luckily, the Chromebook’s reputation as an online-only device isn’t true. For example, Google Docs can be used offline, you can view and edit photos, watch locally-stored media, and play games that don’t require an online connection. It’s really not that different in approach to other PCs, but the overall feel and flow of the experience varies in some key ways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It-feels-like-a-steal"><a href="#Price-It-feels-like-a-steal" class="headerlink" title="Price: It feels like a steal"></a><strong>Price: It feels like a steal</strong></h2><p> Here’s where the Asus Chromebook Flip really makes its biggest impact. As mentioned, it’s a capable computer for most everyday tasks, it has a very good screen, and the battery life is stellar. Best of all, it’s priced at $499, although you can find it for a little bit less (we’re seeing it around $400-450 lately). There are cheaper Chromebooks out there that skimp on features and functionality, such as skipping the convertible hinge or touch functionality, or using a lower-end processor. You can spend a lot less and still get a solid laptop.</p><p> But the Chromebook Flip offers an ideal middle ground between quality and price in the Chromebook department—and compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NHrMPSrgOWsOuCEYg0M-STQUfsU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Air-v-Surface-Comparison-a255967a27e14762b5c2ad9c442df77f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729507&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/TIU/Nero_TuneItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                >&#x2F;a&gt;</p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Asus-Chromebook-Flip-C302CA-vs-Apple-MacBook-Air"><a href="#Asus-Chromebook-Flip-C302CA-vs-Apple-MacBook-Air" class="headerlink" title="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA vs. Apple MacBook Air"></a><strong>Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA vs. Apple MacBook Air</strong></h2><p> On paper, these laptops shouldn’t be comparable. At $1,099 or more, the MacBook Air is one of the most polished and premium ultraportable laptops you can buy today. The perks are obvious: it has a sleek and refined build, the brighter and higher-resolution 13.3-inch display is gorgeous, and the touchpad is excellent. It also runs macOS, a more robust operating system that still manages to be easy to use.</p><p> However, if your computer needs are pretty basic—browsing the web, watching videos, and typing up documents and filling out spreadsheets—then you don’t need a higher-end computer. And the Chromebook Flip has better battery life than the MacBook Air while delivering comparable functionality in many key ways. No doubt, the MacBook Air is the higher-quality option, but at $600 more, we’re not sure it’s worth it for most users.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-air-2018-review-4779750" >Apple MacBook Air (2018) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It’s an excellent, affordable laptop.</strong></p><p> Just as the recent crop of cheap, strong mid-range phones has made many flagship smartphones seem excessive and unnecessary, the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA does much the same for laptops.

This usually manifests in things like poor battery life, low quality screens, and other concessions.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Acer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has managed to defy that stereotype with the Aspire E 15, which smashes the competition in terms of performance, display quality, battery life, and even includes a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-vga-2626027" >VGA port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for anyone who actually needs one of those.</p><p> We put an Acer Aspire E 15 to the test around the office and out in the world to see how it holds up outside of basic benchmarks.

It also tips the scales at over five pounds, which is definitely on the heavy side for a 15.6” laptop.</p><p> The body, lid, and bezel are all plastic, which feels a bit cheap to the touch. But it does have a pleasant brushed pattern that breaks the monotony of the basic black case, and the interior deck features a textured metallic finish that looks and feels significantly better than the rest of the laptop.</p><p> On the right side of the Aspire E 15, you’ll find the power jack, headphone jack, a USB 2.0 port, and a DVD burner. The SD card reader is located on the front of the device, alongside the LED indicator lights. On the left side is the VGA port that Acer still loves to throw on everything, an HDMI port, two USB 3.0 ports, an ethernet jack, and a USB port.</p><p>Aesthetics may be the Acer Aspire E 15’s weakest area.</p><p> The keyboard is roomy and comfortable and the keys feel sharp and springy. The trackpad is massive and responsive, but it doesn’t feel as robust as the keyboard. The left and right buttons are incorporated into the main body of the trackpad, and they have far too much give—if we pressed down with more than the absolute minimum necessary force, it felt like the trackpad might collapse.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove"><a href="#Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: A ton of bloatware to remove"></a><strong>Setup Process:</strong> <strong>A ton of bloatware to remove</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> preloaded, and the setup process isn’t really anything out of the ordinary for a Windows 10 laptop. Acer requests some contact information during the initial setup, which is something that most of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-oem-software-1701736" >OEMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do to help with warranties and support. We timed the process from start to finish, and it took about 10 minutes to go from plugging it in and turning it on, to hitting the desktop for the first time.</p><p> Once you finish the initial setup, most users will also want to take additional time to remove the substantial amount of bloatware that comes preinstalled. This isn’t necessary but is something that most users will probably want to do, and it does add quite a bit of time to the setup process if you opt to go that route.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M-q3UXEJ6htBtTcwPWAH9SLwJeI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-4-1cfdfcc543fa4eb5b5e5449b6ea37413.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color"><a href="#Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color" class="headerlink" title="Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color"></a><strong>Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color</strong></h2><p> While the Aspire E 15’s screen isn’t the brightest or most colorful in the world, it is a full HD display that absolutely shines compared to the low-resolution screens found on a lot of laptops in this category.</p><p> The display has decent viewing angles and great contrast, but the colors are a bit washed out. It’s fine for watching videos on YouTube and Netflix—and DVDs, of course—but it wouldn’t be our first choice for movie night. It’s definitely a display that’s best suited for work, with media and gaming as afterthoughts.</p><h2 id="Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD"><a href="#Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD"></a><strong>Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 suffers a bit from a slow hard drive, and it could stand to have a bit more RAM, but it performs exceedingly well for a laptop in this category. It beats most of the competition in all important benchmarks and is a joy to use for productivity tasks, web browsing, and even light<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000-4148125" >gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 is available in two basic configurations. The unit we tested was the less expensive of the two, featuring an Intel Core i3-8130U running at 2.2 GHz, an Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU, and 6GB DDR3L RAM. The more expensive configuration comes with a Core i7 processor, a discrete<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161" >Nvidia graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , more RAM, and an SSD, so it performs even better.</p><p> We ran the PCMark 10 benchmark, and the Aspire E 15 recorded an overall score of 2,657. It did best in the essentials category, with a score of 5,097, and slightly worse in productivity and digital content creation with scores of 4,534 and 2,203 respectively. In comparison, the similarly-priced Lenovo Ideapad 320 managed an overall score of just 1,062.</p><p> The full HD screen and snappy performance make productivity tasks a breeze.</p><p> So how does that score translate into the real world? It means the Aspire E 15 opens apps without a lot of lag, is capable of multitasking without bogging down, and can juggle more than a dozen web browser windows without skipping a beat, even if you’re streaming video.</p><p> We also ran a few gaming benchmarks from 3DMark, with slightly less stellar results. The first one we tried was Fire Strike, which is designed for gaming laptops. It only managed a score of 855 in that benchmark, running at just 4 FPS during the graphics test and 17 FPS during the physics test.</p><p> That was significantly better than other laptops we tested in this category, but the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU was definitely a bottleneck.</p><p> We also ran the Cloud Gate benchmark, which is designed for low end desktops and basic laptops. That resulted in a score of 6,492 at 36 FPS, indicating that the Aspire E 15 is capable of basic gaming.</p><p> Next up, we installed Steam and fired up Capcom’s blockbuster hit Monster Hunter for a true torture test. Astoundingly, the game was almost playable. It took forever to load into Astera due to the slow HDD, but we set out on a short expedition anyway. The game ran at between 20 and 30 FPS the whole time, but found that the action really bogged down with a big monster on the screen.</p><p> The takeaway is that we absolutely wouldn’t recommend buying this laptop for the purpose of playing games, but it is capable of rising to the task if you’re willing to lower the settings and stick to older games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go"><a href="#Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go"></a><strong>Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go</strong></h2><p> The Aspire E 15 is designed with productivity in mind.

You won’t have to wait around every time you want to load or switch between apps.

Acer advertises a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be a pretty accurate claim.</p><p> Under ideal conditions (and with extremely light use) we found that the battery lasted about 14 hours in our testing. You’re unlikely to achieve this in everyday scenarios, but that’s the baseline maximum you could expect it to last.</p><p> Subjected to normal levels of use—constantly on with the brightness lowered and power management set to favor battery life—we found that the battery lasts about eight and a half hours. With similar settings, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a full day of work or school out of this laptop.</p><p> In a category where a lot of competing devices die out after four or five hours, that’s pretty remarkable.</p><h2 id="Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware"><a href="#Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware" class="headerlink" title="Software: Bogged down by bloatware"></a><strong>Software: Bogged down by bloatware</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with Windows 10, some basic Windows apps, and a free trial of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-office-365-4589808" >Microsoft 365 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Google has disrupted the old-guard tech world, from its software and services to the rise of Android in the mobile space—and it has done much the same in the laptop market with its Chromebook concept. Typically priced well below the competition while delivering strong core services and functionality, the Chrome OS-powered notebooks have become the affordable device of choice for many students, schools, and other budget-minded buyers.  </p><p> Launched in early 2017, the Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA) 12.5-inch laptop has been one of the most popular options, and more than two years later, it’s still on the market. Can this convertible laptop&#x2F;tablet hybrid really supplant ultraportable Windows and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Mac laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at a fraction of the price, or are the compromises too significant to overcome? We spent a week with the Chromebook Flip to see how it compares to today’s competition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3Q2pRvweVt3Gf6RfBaAwQ15QBag=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bottom_04-1508a99e93e94312a9477c6ec5c15022.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice"><a href="#Design-and-Features-It’s-flippin’-nice" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice"></a><strong>Design and Features: It’s flippin’ nice</strong></h2><p> Just as Chromebooks are conceptually designed as budget laptops, the Asus Chromebook Flip is physically built like a budget MacBook. It has the same kind of minimal aesthetic, albeit not to quite the same level of premium visual polish. From the hinge design to the materials and tiny nuances, the Chromebook Flip doesn’t look like a $1,000 laptop.</p><p> That’s not a complaint, just an observation. With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap. It feels like it’s built to deal with the daily stress of usage, but at a weight of just 2.65 pounds, it’s very light and easy to carry around. It does seem to attract dirt and smudges more than a lot of other aluminum laptops we’ve used, although it’s not difficult to rub them away.</p><p> The 12.5-inch touchscreen is a smidge smaller than the common 13-inch laptop screen size, but due to a lot of bezel around the display, the laptop’s overall size is nearly identical to an Apple MacBook Pro (albeit a little thicker). The excessive bezel and large Asus logo do signal the less high-end experience, however.</p><p> With a solid silver aluminum core and durable construction, the Chromebook Flip thankfully doesn’t_feel_ cheap.</p><p> Of course, as the name suggests, the Chromebook Flip does something that no MacBook can: it’s convertible, allowing you to fold the screen all the way back into a tablet form, or use a tent-like design to prop the device up and watch videos. The hinge feels sturdy in any position, thankfully, so you don’t have to worry about the tent falling flat, or the screen flopping around in any mode.</p><p> We’ve been using the Chromebook Flip in the tent mode to watch Twitch streams or YouTube playlists while washing dishes or making dinner, or having it run in the corner of a desk while doing other work. It’s super handy to have around as a portable, self-standing streaming display. And in the tablet format, with the screen fully folded back, it’s totally useful. It feels a bit odd to press your fingers against the keys while holding it, but don’t worry: they’re disabled in that form.</p><p> Like current MacBooks, the Chromebook Flip is all about USB-C ports; it puts one on each side and skips full-sized USB-A ports entirely. You can charge the laptop from either of those ports, and that versatility is appreciated. However, there’s also a microSD card port on the right, which is handy as the 64GB internal storage on this model is pretty slim (there are 32GB and 128GB versions available, as well), along with a 3.5mm headphone port on the left side.</p><p> The Chromebook Flip’s keyboard feels great in action. The one-piece chiclet keyboard has a scissor-style key design with 1.4mm of travel, which gives it a more satisfying feel than the latest MacBooks’ keys (which have very little travel), and the keys are responsive and not especially loud in usage. It’s also brightly backlit, which isn’t always the case with Chromebooks. The touchpad below is nicely sized and wider than some we’ve seen, although not nearly as large as Apple’s luxurious trackpads of late.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-sweat-whatsoever" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever"></a><strong>Setup Process: No sweat whatsoever</strong></h2><p> Setting up a Chromebook is incredibly easy. Just power it on (the button is on the left side), connect to a network, accept the terms of service and choose from any options that you’re prompted to, and then plug in your Google account info. If you do already have a Google account, then any bookmarks, Chrome extensions, and apps will automatically be added. If you don’t have a Google account, then you’ll need to sign up for one to use the Chromebook. In any case, this whole process shouldn’t take more than a matter of minutes to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AFQh-ERthm-g0pAMcnQlyA2Rjgw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_bent_02-3dfd0720309d4d12beb5ae695a007aa1.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Display-Small-but-strong"><a href="#Display-Small-but-strong" class="headerlink" title="Display: Small, but strong"></a><strong>Display: Small, but strong</strong></h2><p> As mentioned, the Chromebook Flip’s 12.5-inch, 1080p screen is a little smaller than you’ll see on some rivals, but that doesn’t take away from its usability. It’s colorful and nicely vibrant, and text and graphics typically look crisp. It’s not one of the brightest screens we’ve seen, with a listed brightness of about 300 nits, but that’s pretty common amongst laptops. It’s a little dimmer than we’d like, admittedly. Visibility is impacted in direct sunlight, but in most situations, it’s hard to complain too much about this screen.</p><p> It also acts like an extra-large tablet screen since it’s a touchscreen with 10 points of interaction. It felt just as responsive as any tablet we’ve used.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It-does-what-it-can"><a href="#Performance-It-does-what-it-can" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It does what it can"></a><strong>Performance: It does what it can</strong></h2><p> You really can’t pit the Chromebook Flip against pricier Windows and Mac laptops in terms of sheer processing power because Chromebooks aren’t built to be beasts. But they don’t really need to be: the highest quality of graphics processing it’ll need to handle are mobile-quality games, since the Chromebook Flip can run Android apps from the Play Store, and you’re not able to download high-end games from Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p><p> The version of the Chromebook Flip we tested came with a 2.2Ghz Intel Core M3-6Y30 chip, although you can get versions with a Core M7 or Pentium 4405Y chip for more power. Paired with 4GB RAM, we found the device to be plenty speedy getting around Chrome OS.</p><p> Compared to rival laptops like the MacBook Air or Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, you’ll save a huge amount of money while still being able to complete a wide array of tasks.</p><p> Given the access to the Play Store, we benchmarked the Chromebook Flip using the same tests we use for Android phones, with a score of 8,818 on the PCMark 2.0 Work test. The Intel HD Graphics 515 integrated graphics, meanwhile, delivered a frame rate of 12 frames per second in the Car Chase demo and 53 frames per second in the T-Rex demo. Essentially, the Chromebook Flip seems comparable to an upper mid-range Android phone.</p><p> That comparison held up when playing Android racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, which ran at a pretty smooth clip but definitely looked fuzzier than usual thanks to being blown up for the larger screen. Online battle royale shooter PUBG Mobile also ran solidly, although the keyboard and trackpad combination didn’t feel right. We folded the screen back entirely and just used the touchscreen, which worked fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7B1-43v0GHPcS2HESabWT97_XPQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Asus-Chromebook_Keyboard_03-8bc37c7c2d0243bb8ed1fa10e338374f.jpg"                      alt="Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17727588&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a><br><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17727588&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/Affiliates_300x250px_valentinesday.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Sounds-fine"><a href="#Audio-Sounds-fine" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Sounds fine"></a><strong>Audio: Sounds fine</strong></h2><p> The tiny speaker grates on the left and right side of the Chromebook Flip don’t look too promising, but the playback quality was better than expected.

We went online at a home network and a Starbucks Google network alike, and things were routinely speedy. On the home network, we saw speeds of about 33Mbps and upload speeds in excess of 10Mbps—essentially the same as we’ve seen with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >other laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth"><a href="#Battery-Nearly-a-day’s-worth" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Nearly a day’s worth"></a><strong>Battery: Nearly a day’s worth</strong></h2><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life. The 39Wh battery cell is rated for up to 10 hours, and while that estimate is ambitious for everyday use, we typically saw seven or more hours of mixed usage with the screen at full brightness. That’s for our usual workflow of surfing the web, typing out documents, watching some YouTube videos, and streaming music from Spotify.</p><p> Even with a budget-friendly price, the Asus Chromebook Flip 12.5-inch doesn’t skimp on battery life.</p><p> Our laptop video rundown test, which streams a Netflix movie over Wi-Fi while at 100 percent brightness, delivered a similar result: it lasted 6 hours, 57 minutes before the Chromebook Flip shut down.

It’s a much simpler approach to PC usage, focusing only on essential features and functionality. The interface has a PC-like bar at the bottom, but it’s really more like an app dock on your phone or tablet. Unsurprisingly, the experience is built around Google’s own apps, coming preloaded with the Chrome web browser, Google Docs, YouTube, Google Photos, Google Maps, and more.</p><p> Since the Chromebook Flip’s original release, Google has added the ability to run Android apps downloaded from the Play Store. This is the same Play Store found on scads of smartphones and tablets the world over, offering access to a wide array of games and apps. Not every app looks or acts perfectly on a larger screen, but we mostly had success: business chat app Slack looked like the desktop version on PC and Mac, as did Spotify.

That’s not a Chromebook.</p><p> Luckily, the Chromebook’s reputation as an online-only device isn’t true. For example, Google Docs can be used offline, you can view and edit photos, watch locally-stored media, and play games that don’t require an online connection.

Best of all, it’s priced at $499, although you can find it for a little bit less (we’re seeing it around $400-450 lately). There are cheaper Chromebooks out there that skimp on features and functionality, such as skipping the convertible hinge or touch functionality, or using a lower-end processor.

The perks are obvious: it has a sleek and refined build, the brighter and higher-resolution 13.3-inch display is gorgeous, and the touchpad is excellent. It also runs macOS, a more robust operating system that still manages to be easy to use.</p><p> However, if your computer needs are pretty basic—browsing the web, watching videos, and typing up documents and filling out spreadsheets—then you don’t need a higher-end computer. And the Chromebook Flip has better battery life than the MacBook Air while delivering comparable functionality in many key ways. No doubt, the MacBook Air is the higher-quality option, but at $600 more, we’re not sure it’s worth it for most users.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-air-2018-review-4779750" >Apple MacBook Air (2018) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It’s an excellent, affordable laptop.</strong></p><p> Just as the recent crop of cheap, strong mid-range phones has made many flagship smartphones seem excessive and unnecessary, the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA does much the same for laptops.
