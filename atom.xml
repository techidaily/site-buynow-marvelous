class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in an iPhone 14 Plus Case"></a>What to Look for in an iPhone 14 Plus Case</h2><p> Choosing the right iPhone 14 Plus phone case isn’t easy. Not only do you want something stylish, but you also want a case that provides plenty of protection for your expensive new gadget.</p><p> Figuring out how much you want to spend is a good starting point. Cases nowadays come with various price tags. For example, budget cases can be as cheap as $15, while high-end products can soar to over $60.</p><p> Once you’ve determined a price range, the next step is to decide how much protection you need. Some cases undergo strenuous testing to ensure they’ll save your phone when slipping out of your hand and hitting the pavement.</p><p> Others are engineered to be as slim as possible while still retaining some durability. The size of a case and its protective prowess are often directly correlated—a bulkier case will offer you better resistance from cracks, scratches, and accidental drops.</p><p> The last important factor to consider is design. The Apple iPhone 14 Plus is a sleek device, and it’d be a shame to hide it behind an unsightly case. If you’re truly connected to the style of the iPhone 14 Plus, it might be worth picking up a clear case.</p><p> Otherwise, you’ll get to choose from leather cases, wallet cases, rugged cases, and an assortment of other formats that fit every lifestyle imaginable.</p><p> Finding the best case for your iPhone 14 Plus is highly subjective, but focusing on the above criteria (pricing, durability, and design) will help you narrow your search and home a product perfectly suited for your needs.</p><p> These cases are only for the iPhone 14 Plus and are incompatible with other iPhone models. If you need another model’s cases, check out our <a class="link"   href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >best iPhone cases roundup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>7</td><td>15</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

Combine that with an easy install process and a guarantee for no residue should you remove it, and it’s easy to see why dbrand skins are so popular.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dbrand-iphone-14-plus-1.jpg"                      alt="dbrand-iPhone-14-Plus-1"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Thin iPhone 14 Plus Case</p><h5 id="dbrand-Matte-Black-iPhone-14-Plus-Skin-1"><a href="#dbrand-Matte-Black-iPhone-14-Plus-Skin-1" class="headerlink" title="dbrand Matte Black iPhone 14 Plus Skin"></a>dbrand Matte Black iPhone 14 Plus Skin</h5><p>It won’t provide much drop protection, but this ultra-thin looks sleek while saving your iPhone 14 Plus from scratches.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://dbrand.com/shop/iphone-14-plus-skins" >DBrand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484951/16446" target="_top" id="1484951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484951/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Leather-iPhone-14-Plus-Case-Apple-Leather-Case-with-MagSafe"><a href="#Best-Leather-iPhone-14-Plus-Case-Apple-Leather-Case-with-MagSafe" class="headerlink" title="Best Leather iPhone 14 Plus Case: Apple Leather Case with MagSafe"></a>Best Leather iPhone 14 Plus Case: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Leather-MagSafe/dp/B0BDHHTDY2?tag=htg-v2-3phmmbk-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204394&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/833775/best-iphone-14-plus-cases/&asc_campaign=Short-Term" >Apple Leather Case with MagSafe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Leather-MagSafe/dp/B0BDHHTDY2?tag=htg-v2-3phmmbk-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204394&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/833775/best-iphone-14-plus-cases/&asc_campaign=Short-Term" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Leather-MagSafe/dp/B0BDHHTDY2?tag=htg-v2-3phmmbk-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204394&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/833775/best-iphone-14-plus-cases/&asc_campaign=Short-Term"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-leahter-case-iphone-14-plus.jpg"                      alt="Apple leather case on grey background"                > Apple</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Leather-MagSafe/dp/B0BDHHTDY2?tag=htg-v2-3phmmbk-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204394&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/833775/best-iphone-14-plus-cases/&asc_campaign=Short-Term" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Official Apple product</td><td>✗ Expensive</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Wide range of colors</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ Premium materials</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Constructed from “specially tanned and finished leather,” the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Leather-MagSafe/dp/B0BDHHTDY2?tag=htg-v2-3phmmbk-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204394&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/833775/best-iphone-14-plus-cases/&asc_campaign=Short-Term" >Apple iPhone 14 Plus Leather Case with MagSafe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is about as premium as it gets.

Perfectly sculpted to the iPhone 14 Plus, you can rest assured every inch of your expensive gadget is protected. The package is completed with built-in magnets for MagSafe, the availability of multiple colors, and an installation process that simply requires you to snap in your iPhone.</p><p> Those premium materials and specs come at a price, and its $60 price tag might seem a bit hefty. But if you’re looking for a stylish case that’s also functional, Apple’s Leather Case needs to be near the top of your list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/210lexf-hpl-_sl500_-1.jpg"                      alt="210lEXf-HpL._SL500_-1"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Leather iPhone 14 Plus Case</p><h5 id="Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Leather-Case-with-MagSafe-1"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Leather-Case-with-MagSafe-1" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 14 Plus Leather Case with MagSafe"></a>Apple iPhone 14 Plus Leather Case with MagSafe</h5><p>With a leather design that’ll pick up a gorgeous patina with use, this high-end case is a great option if you don’t mind the $60 price tag.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Leather-MagSafe/dp/B0BDHHTDY2?tag=htg-v2-3phmmbk-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204394&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/833775/best-iphone-14-plus-cases/&asc_campaign=Short-Term" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple__iphone_14_plu/6341091.p?skuId=6341091" >Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/156932/564546/9358?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU204394&subId2=ehtg&u=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fapple%255Fiphone%255F14%255Fplus%252F-%252FA-85963411" >Target <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-flip-the-like-ratio-with-squared-up-social-media-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Flip the Like Ratio with Squared-Up Social Media Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-best-video-apps-review-youtube-iphones-and-androids/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Video Apps Review YouTube iPhones & Androids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-first-steps-to-faster-film-playback-in-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, First Steps to Faster Film Playback in Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-samsungs-latest-tablet-galaxy-tab-s7-tailored-for-true-android-admirers/"><u>Comprehensive Review of Samsung's Latest Tablet, Galaxy Tab S7 – Tailored for True Android Admirers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-metaverse-race-begins-dont-miss-these-7-essential-tools/"><u>In 2024, The Metaverse Race Begins Don't Miss These 7 Essential Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/navigating-power-dynamics-within-tropico-6-steering-a-fictional-paradise/"><u>Navigating Power Dynamics Within Tropico 6: Steering a Fictional Paradise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/solved-cominterop-failure-windows-system/"><u>Solved: COMInterop Failure Windows System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/top-wi-fi-signal-boosters-enhancing-your-network-coverage/"><u>Top Wi-Fi Signal Boosters : Enhancing Your Network Coverage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unlock-endless-communication-try-tango-for-zero-cost-talks-and-texts/"><u>Unlock Endless Communication - Try Tango for Zero Cost Talks and Texts!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-mystery-of-vyncs-links-user-experience-and-subscriptions/"><u>Unraveling the Mystery of Vyncs Link's User Experience & Subscriptions</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A New Update Explained"></a>Will Spotify Begin Charging for Lyric Snippets? A New Update Explained</h2><p>Free Spotify accounts can’t play songs in any order, download music for offline play, or get the highest audio quality. There’s now another feature being removed: the ability to view song lyrics.</p><p> A new warning has started appearing for some free Spotify users, explaining that there is a monthly limit on how many times you can view lyrics for a given song. After you reach that limit, you can’t view the lyrics for more songs unless you <a class="link"   href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-digital-drama-videoviral-sagas-unfold-online/" >sign up for Spotify Premium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Spotify was testing a similar change as early as September 2023, but now it seems to be rolling out more widely. The company declined to explain the change to <em>TechCrunch</em>, only saying that Spotify’s features can vary over time depending on the region and device. Presumably, Spotify is preparing to roll the change out to all free accounts, but for now it’s still only affecting a subset of users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gmbstdrxyaayu3c.jpg"                      alt="Spotify screenshot: &quot;There&#39;s a monthly limit on lyrics. Every time you tap Show lyrics, it will count towards your limit. To get full access to lyrics, switch to Spotify Premium.&quot;"                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/SleepyyGoose/status/1785345538486911398" >@SleepyyGoose (Twitter&#x2F;X) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> It’s a bit bizarre to lock song lyrics behind a paywall, considering most other audio platforms with free tiers offer lyrics, including YouTube Music. The text is also usually available on third-party websites like Genius or apps like Shazam. Spotify does synchronize the lyrics to the music for some tracks, like a karaoke video, but that feature is not available on all songs.</p><p> Spotify seems to be hoping access to lyrics could push more people to Spotify Premium, but it’s not clear if that will work out. The company’s <a class="link"   href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-04-23/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2024-earnings/" >Q1 2024 earnings report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> revealed Spotify now has 615 million monthly active users (MAUs), but only 239 million paid subscribers. In other words, less than half of Spotify’s userbase has Spotify Premium. The price for Spotify Premium also went up in the United States and other countries in 2023, and <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-disconnecting-from-your-old-linkedin-account/" >Spotify is planning another price increase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Spotify <a class="link"   href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216950219/spotify-layoffs-17-percent-tech" >laid off 17% of its staff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in December, after two more rounds of layoffs earlier that year, also in an effort to boost profits. The company then reported record profits in Q1 2024, and in the Q1 earnings call, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek <a class="link"   href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/04/26/spotifys-recent-layoffs-impacted-the-company-more-than-anticipated/?sh=3a20626e4139" >said <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the job cuts “did disrupt our day-to-day operations more than we anticipated.”</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/spotify-is-quietly-moves-lyrics-behind-a-paywall/" >TechCrunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-blackout-blitz-premiere-pro-60s-for-2024/"><u>[New] Blackout Blitz Premiere Pro 60S for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-clan-the-challenge-best-games-similar-to-ghost-of-tsushima-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Clan the Challenge Best Games Similar to Ghost of Tsushima for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/crime-quest-clones-video-game-list-like-gta-v-for-2024/"><u>Crime Quest Clones Video Game List Like GTA V for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/cross-platform-steinberg-audio-driver-downloads/"><u>Cross-Platform Steinberg Audio Driver Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-the-most-economical-cell-phone-deals-for-2atur2024-savings-that-count/"><u>Discover the Most Economical Cell Phone Deals for 2Atur2024: Savings That Count!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-top-ranking-accessories-the-best-mice-tailored-for-ipads/"><u>Discover Top-Ranking Accessories: The Best Mice Tailored for iPads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/echo-pop-vs-echo-dot-which-one-suits-you-best/"><u>Echo Pop Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac) joins the Kinesis keyboard family with its easy-to-use modular design. Better yet, this ergonomic keyboard supports up to three connected devices at a time, allowing you to easily swap between a Mac, iPhone, or iPad with the press of a few hotkeys. With its compact build, the Kinesis Freestyle2 is a welcome addition to any Apple user’s collection, whether they’re at home or on the go, thanks to the excellent battery life of up to 300 plus hours of extended use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold"></a><strong>Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold</strong></h2><p> For people who are tethered to their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/computer-and-laptop-reviews-4102643" >computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ergonomic keyboards are a must. These keyboards tend to be large thanks to the frequently employed swoop design that opens up the keys to provide additional spacing, so fingers feel less cramped, and a wrist-friendly position that prevents<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while typing. These keyboards are typically space hogs, taking up large portions of any surface that they’re placed on, often forcing users to reach further for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-mice-6666207" >mice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can lead to shoulder injuries in place of wrist injuries—a trade-off no one wants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C-YK_WPWu8Ujx1fwDLxvO6Epi-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_05-adcddc5fc05b415dbcd82396bc0ada77.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac breaks free of these norms by using a split, modular design that features two keyboard halves, one for each hand, connected via a 9 or 20-inch cable depending upon the chosen model. These pieces were designed with comfort in mind. They may be used separately or connected with a pivot tether at the top of the two halves. This allows you the opportunity to customize your setup and maximize your comfort, whether that’s by placing the halves closer together or further apart.</p><p> The Freestyle2’s minimum size is 15.4 inches in length, but it can extend to a maximum length of 23.5 inches (37.75 inches for the 20-inch model). It uses a standard key layout, so it’s familiar and easy to adjust to, while the low-impact design means that the keys need less pressure to type and are quieter. Additionally, its backside is free of risers letting your wrists sit in a neutral, comfortable position that helps prevent injuries over time.</p><p> Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300-plus hours of regular use.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack. Whether you’re commuting between the home and the office or you’re heading out of town for a vacation, it’s easy to break down and bring anywhere so long as there’s a flat surface to place it during use.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only"><a href="#Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: For Apple products only"></a><strong>Setup Process: For Apple products only</strong></h2><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue arrives with the two keyboard halves, the instructional pamphlet, and a six-foot USB charging cable. Designed for use with iPads,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-and-ios-4781515" >iPhones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macs-4781332" >Macs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the setup process is quick and easy to complete. First, we flipped the switch on the right-hand side of the keyboard from the off position to the on position. Then, we flipped the keyboard over and pressed the connect button on the backside. We knew it was ready to begin pairing when the lights on the frontside began flashing blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XHY6Xe9cdaO1U6Uj0wDY6rROlcA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_04-7fad98b589454e0388ecf48afe425e8c.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139110/17108" target="_top" id="2139110">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139110" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139110/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> From here, we followed the instructions in the provided instructional pamphlet and enabled Bluetooth on our iPad. After about a minute of scanning, the Kinesis KB800MB-BT keyboard appeared as an available device. We simply tapped to connect. From here, it prompted us to input a numeric code and press return. Once we’d done this, setup was complete.</p><h2 id="Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them"><a href="#Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them" class="headerlink" title="Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them"></a><strong>Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them</strong></h2><p> Better than its modular design are the easy-to-use hotkeys on the left-hand side of the keyboard. These make it simple to copy, paste, cut, go back or forward in a browser, or even switch between the keyboard’s connected devices smoothly and efficiently. They take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it using them is a breeze.</p><p> One pet peeve we had with the keyboard design was the Caps lock key. Instead of having a light on the button itself that glows when the function is enabled, this light is placed alongside the Bluetooth connectivity lights on the right-hand side of the keyboard. While this isn’t the end of the world by any means, it’s less intuitive since you need to retrain yourself on where to look to see if it’s enabled. Additionally, you should be aware that leaving this button on or using it frequently can lead to faster battery drain.</p><p> Its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528688/16446" target="_top" id="1528688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528688/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind"><a href="#Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind"></a><strong>Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Freestyle2 is excellent. It arrives with a partial charge, so it’s important to remember to fully charge it after receiving it. Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300 plus hours of regular use. The Freestyle2 does an excellent job of letting you know when its battery is getting low—battery lights will flash red to indicate when there are about four hours of battery life remaining. This ensures you’re never left hanging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948949/19272" target="_top" id="1948949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Excellent-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Excellent-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Excellent for the features"></a><strong>Price: Excellent for the features</strong></h2><p> Full-size ergonomic keyboards tend to retail anywhere from $50 to $200, depending on the features involved. Generally retailing for about $100 on Amazon, the Freestyle2 sits comfortably at the front of this curve. While $100 may seem expensive for a keyboard, consider the features involved. Its travel-friendly build, adjustable setup options, extended battery life, and ability to switch quickly and smoothly between multiple connected devices make it an excellent choice for the features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vncgu0FEgBJ69UL6H8BjQ2QoGRI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_03-9055476d1d974c8bbe9b1c39d479b300.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> Not all keyboards are created equal, and while the split, modular design offered by the Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue creates wonderful customization options, there’s something to be said for having a full keyboard. For Apple users willing to take a leap into Microsoft products, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard shines through as an excellent option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780274" >Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While it may seem odd to lean into Microsoft products for Mac lovers, its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys. It also arrives with a mouse and detached numpad, which are some nice perks as the Freestyle2 doesn’t include the numpad, although it is available as an accessory for an additional $40. The Windows key may also be mapped to the command key on the Sculpt. Generally retailing for about $80-$120, the Sculpt is around the same price as the Kinesis.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack.</p><p> One drawback to this device is that the receiver dongle used to pair the Sculpt to your computer is associated with the keyboard at the factory. This is because the keyboard features encryption technology in order to protect your keystrokes. If this dongle is lost, there simply is no replacing it. With this information in mind, this keyboard would do best in an environment where it stays put rather than the Freestyle2 which is much more travel-friendly thanks to its compact nature and Bluetooth pairing capabilities.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ideal keyboard for Apple users with its compact design, portability, and long-lasting battery.</strong></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac is a compact, user-friendly ergonomic keyboard that takes comfort and customization to the next level for Apple users thanks to its split, modular design.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Battle-Intensifies-as-More-Users-Block-Advertisements-on-YouTube"><a href="#The-Battle-Intensifies-as-More-Users-Block-Advertisements-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Battle Intensifies as More Users Block Advertisements on YouTube"></a>The Battle Intensifies as More Users Block Advertisements on YouTube</h2><p>Not so long ago, it was easy to avoid YouTube ads by installing an adblocker. Now, YouTube has upped the ante, and its fight against adblockers could endanger the very creators who use the platform as their source of revenue. But how exactly is YouTube losing the war against adblockers?</p><h2 id="YouTube-Needs-You-To-See-Their-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Needs-You-To-See-Their-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Needs You To See Their Ads"></a>YouTube Needs You To See Their Ads</h2><p> While YouTube is a content creation platform, it’s also an advertising platform. Businesses pay a lot of money to advertise on the site, and the company, in turn, inserts relevant advertising into videos that fit the topic of the ad. The problem isn’t so much the advertising (or <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/swift-switcheroo-rearranging-yt-lists-in-a-minute/" >how long the TV ads have gotten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) as it is the number of ads a user has to wait for before they get to the content they want.</p><p> When YouTube first debuted in-video ads, they occasionally placed one at the front of the video. There was a good chance that you could click on a video and not be forced to watch the first five seconds of an ad. However, this process revealed that people would click on ads, which made the company ramp up its ad distribution. Now, depending on the video length, you’ll have to wait through several “ad breaks” interspersed throughout the video.</p><p> Naturally, the increase in the number of ads meant consumers who didn’t want to see them installed adblockers on their browsers. Adblockers are extensions or programs that examine a page’s code while it loads, comparing links coming into the browser to a set of existing domains. If it finds a domain listed on its “ad list,” it’ll block the domain from loading, thereby stopping the ad.</p><p> This is a significant problem for YouTube. YouTube guarantees its advertisers that they’ll have the eyes of their audience; to do that, they ensure that ads are placed in the video at specific intervals. Adblockers remove those ads from loading and reduce the number of clicks advertisers get. With more people using those plugins and applications, YouTube had to take drastic measures to ensure it would still be a viable advertising medium. Those measures included declaring war on ads.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047366/19272" target="_top" id="2047366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-YouTube-Aimed-to-Foil-Adblockers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Aimed-to-Foil-Adblockers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Aimed to Foil Adblockers"></a>How YouTube Aimed to Foil Adblockers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/an-iphone-and-a-galaxy-s24-on-youtube-and-an-ipad-in-the-center-with-the-youtube-logo-and-a-download-icon-1.jpg"                      alt="An iPhone and a Galaxy S24 on YouTube, and an iPad in the center with the YouTube logo and a download icon. (1)"                > </p><p>Lucas Gouveia &#x2F; How-To Geek | Best Buy</p><p> The mission seemed simple at first: find a way to circumvent adblocking software and plugins. The first thing that YouTube did was implement some code to detect if the browser was running adblocking software or a plugin. At the start, all this would do is <a class="link"   href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2023/10/17/youtubes-anti-adblock-feature-frustrates-users/" >warn the user <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that they have an adblocker and ask them to turn it off. However, this polite approach wasn’t working, so YouTube decided to up the ante.</p><p> When the company realized that asking users to turn off their adblocker wasn’t working, it decided to block video playback for users still running an adblocker. This forced many users to choose—either leave the platform and find somewhere else to watch their videos or turn off their adblocker, leaving them vulnerable to ads when they leave the platform. The third option—allowing only YouTube to display ads—could be used, but few users seemed willing or able to allow specific sites to be permitted through their ad blocker.</p><p> Eventually, when these methods failed to work, YouTube resorted to <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14129599" >telling users that having an adblocker was against their terms of service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and that their YouTube account could be suspended or removed for having one. For many platform users, this was the last straw, and some simply left to seek entertainment elsewhere.</p><p> Users were unhappy about this since it removed any agency they had. The formerly free site was now inundated with ads. Many have just <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/-cutting-edge-apps-top-10-for-editing-youtube-shorts/" >stopped watching YouTube altogether <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and opted for other entertainment outlets. While this seemed to affect YouTube users a lot, it also had a knock-on effect on the creators who used the website for their livelihood.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Adblockers-Can-Hurt-Content-Creators-Too"><a href="#Adblockers-Can-Hurt-Content-Creators-Too" class="headerlink" title="Adblockers Can Hurt Content Creators, Too"></a>Adblockers Can Hurt Content Creators, Too</h2><p> YouTube’s payment system depends on how much interest a creator attracts from the internet. Based on YouTube’s ad-sharing revenue system, channels with more subscribers and videos with more views tend to get paid more. If users don’t watch ads, YouTube has less ad revenue to distribute to creators.</p><p> However, with YouTube’s demonetization guidelines changing rapidly, some creators have left the site or only maintained their presence there as a funnel for their own creative endeavors off the site. Many video creators rely on sponsorships from products or direct monetary support from their as a means of earning now, since they can’t rely on YouTube’s payments anymore.</p><p> While this can be a hassle, it’s also a positive. Creating good content on one’s own encourages users who enjoy and support that content to be more active in its creation. Moving those users off-platform also helps the creator convert them from “borrowed” followers to subscribers who can pay a consistent monthly amount, ensuring income keeps coming in from their creative endeavors. YouTube’s alienation of its user base reinforces this behavior.</p><h2 id="Does-This-Mean-That-YouTube-is-Dying"><a href="#Does-This-Mean-That-YouTube-is-Dying" class="headerlink" title="Does This Mean That YouTube is Dying?"></a>Does This Mean That YouTube is Dying?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/youtube-tv-logo-with-several-coins-falling-around.jpg"                      alt="Youtube TV logo with several coins falling around."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043597/7443" target="_top" id="2043597">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043597" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043597/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lucas Gouveia &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Many Internet commentators have stated that YouTube’s war with adblockers could finally kill the platform outright. The site has already implemented strategies that block dedicated programs that allow for ad-free YouTube videos. However, YouTube has offered alternatives for users who want to watch ad-free content.</p><p> YouTube Premium is the paid tier of the platform; however, at $10.99 a month, it’s <a class="link"   href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-for-seamless-update-of-windows-scansnap-ix500-printer-drivers/" >a bit much for most people based on what it offers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The company <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-effortlessly-replay-videos-on-iphone/" >used to have a cheaper, low-cost option <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it removed that one in a push for better monetization. The truth is that while YouTube offers good content, it’s not worth the price to most users.</p><p> There have also been extensive workarounds to prevent the YouTube ad sensor from triggering, letting people watch content ad-free anyway. YouTube is probably not dying, but its monetization methodology needs a lot of work if it’s going to survive the twenty-first century.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Adblock-War-Is-Far-From-Over"><a href="#The-Adblock-War-Is-Far-From-Over" class="headerlink" title="The Adblock War Is Far From Over"></a>The Adblock War Is Far From Over</h2><p> YouTube’s stance on adblockers has made it clear that it is not interested in compromising. The company wants users to view ads and will go to great lengths to ensure that it happens. As for the users, some have migrated out of YouTube’s ecosystem and an increasing number have connected directly to their preferred subscribers on other platforms, and the incessant stream of workarounds to block ads on the platform proves plenty of viewers aren’t willing to yield ground either. YouTube is adapting by <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/-inspiration-free-soundtracks-to-enhance-projects/" >implementing a new methodology for ad delivery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Creators are moving their businesses out of YouTube, but new creators are constantly springing up. The company’s ongoing war with adblockers might have a few casualties, but unless the company changes its monetization methodology, it will have a long road ahead.</p><p> If nothing else, YouTube’s own rise to prominence (and streaming services generally) shows just how willing consumers are to change their habits if something better comes along.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-discovering-the-worlds-most-popular-shorter-videos-free-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discovering the World's Most Popular Shorter Videos (FREE) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unfortunately-contacts-has-stopped-error-on-oneplus-12r-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Unfortunately, Contacts Has Stopped Error on OnePlus 12R | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-commencing-shoot-critical-overview/"><u>In 2024, Commencing Shoot Critical Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/lunapic-101-a-step-by-step-photo-editing-guide/"><u>LunaPic 101 A Step-by-Step Photo Editing Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-vivo-y36i-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/"><u>Pattern Locks Are Unsafe Secure Your Vivo Y36i Phone Now with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-evaluation-of-the-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-revolutionizing-how-you-read-books/"><u>The Ultimate Evaluation of the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 2018: Revolutionizing How You Read Books</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-and-reviewing-apples-new-4k-streaming-device-third-generation/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Using and Reviewing Apple's New 4K Streaming Device (Third Generation)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-rated-iseebell-video-doorbells-for-less-than-50/"><u>Top Rated ISeeBell Video Doorbells for Less Than $50!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unboxing-the-new-oculus-quest-top-of-the-line-wristband-extra-power-source-and-handy-storage-case-a-complete-review/"><u>Unboxing the New Oculus Quest 지이템스트러피: Top-of-the-Line Wristband, Extra Power Source, and Handy Storage Case - A Complete Review!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Since the brand’s rebirth at the hands of HMD Global, it’s become known for phones that pack in some surprising features at a fairly affordable price point.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 exemplifies that trend, with an attractive chunky design, great screen, and a clean, stock version of Android thanks to the Android One program—all at a price that’s competitive with other mid-range handsets.</p><p> The mid-range Android market is a crowded field, so we put the Nokia 7.1 to the test around the office and at home to see how it holds up in real-world, day-to-day use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-smartphones-577403" >Phone Reviews &amp; Top Picks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-A-mid-range-phone-with-high-end-sensibilities"><a href="#Design-A-mid-range-phone-with-high-end-sensibilities" class="headerlink" title="Design: A mid-range phone with high-end sensibilities"></a><strong>Design: A mid-range phone with high-end sensibilities</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset that could pass for a higher-end device if you squint. It features the same general design—a glass front and back separated by an aluminum body—that we’ve seen so many times before, but it has a few design tweaks that help it stand out. The matte aluminum body features chamfered edges that add a bit of visual flair, especially when they catch the light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1cMJEwjyd7B1WxBO7uBZOm0C2So=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_3-483bfb6a868848adaaf021846b9fb559.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> The buttons are all located on the right side of the device, and they feature the same chamfered shape as the main body of the phone. The positioning of the buttons makes them easy to hit with your index finger when you hold the device in your left hand, or with your thumb if you hold it in your right.</p><p> When you turn the screen on, the first thing you notice is a chunky notch at the top. This notch is the reason that the phone is able to boast a 5.8-inch display, but it seems like a strange choice when paired with the thick “chin” at the bottom of the screen. This use of space definitely looks mid-range.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NRHkz82CaIGpj9N3UQuqHzPSBas=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_4-2c6261afee9644848e68fbf1e73c3009.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Requires-updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Process-Requires-updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Requires updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup Process: Requires updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Nokia 7.1 is a breeze if you have a Google account ready to go. Since it uses stock Android and is part of the Android One program, there aren’t any extra hoops to jump through. The only hiccup we experienced was the flood of required updates right out of the box—make sure you allow some extra time to download and install everything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LkCNBmkQjVwHH-SoT7i4QFOrSsk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_1-83b2f49a5f2c4443b2b7f30b502fd094.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037338/7443" target="_top" id="2037338">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037338" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037338/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-a-mid-range-handset"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-a-mid-range-handset" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for a mid-range handset"></a><strong>Performance: Great for a mid-range handset</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a powerhouse, but it offers great performance compared to a lot of other mid-range handsets. It features the Snapdragon 636 processor, Adreno 509 GPU, and 4GB of RAM, which is pretty good for a mid-range device like this.</p><p> We ran PCMark’s Work 2.0 benchmark, which tests how well a phone is able to handle basic productivity tasks like web browsing, word processing, and even editing photos and videos. It received a respectable score of 6,113. That lags behind higher-end devices but compares very favorably to handsets in this price range.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 showed great strength in photo editing with a massive score of 11,093 but lagged behind in data manipulation with a score of 4,792.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset in terms of price, but it packs a lot of features that you’d expect from a much more expensive phone.</p><p> We also ran two GFXBench tests to see how the Nokia 7.1 holds up. It performed poorly on the Car Chase benchmark, only managing 5.8 fps, but it did much better on the T-Rex test, notching a much more acceptable 33 fps.</p><p> In real-world conditions, the Nokia 7.1 is snappy enough that it won’t trip you up during regular daily tasks like web browsing, email, and streaming video. It’s also powerful enough to run some games, but you’ll have to stay away from the highest graphics settings.</p><p> It’s important to note that when the Nokia 7.1 launched, it was plagued with complaints about slow operation, lag, and an unresponsive touchscreen. These appear to have been software-related issues that have since been fixed, as we experienced no such problems in our hands-on testing.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Data-connection-is-slow"><a href="#Connectivity-Data-connection-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Data connection is slow"></a><strong>Connectivity: Data connection is slow</strong></h2><p> In our testing, the Nokia 7.1 performed exceedingly well when connected to Wi-Fi, but it had far more problems with mobile data compared to similar handsets we tested. Connected to T-Mobile’s 4G LTE network (indoors), the Nokia 7.1 achieved 4.03 Mbps down and just 0.11 Mbps up via the Ookla Speedtest app. Tested at the same time, in the same location, a Google Pixel 3 recorded 4.69 Mbps down and 1.33 Mbps up.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 exhibited similar speed issues when tested in other locations despite showing a very strong connection. The highest speeds we were able to achieve, with full reception bars, were 18.0 Mbps down and 1.42 Mbps up (compared to 37.8 Mbps down and 7.23 Mbps up measured on a Pixel 3 in the same location at the same time).</p><p> Despite these connectivity problems, we were still able to stream YouTube videos and music from Google Play over the data connection.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Quality-HDR-quality-with-a-chunky-notch"><a href="#Display-Quality-HDR-quality-with-a-chunky-notch" class="headerlink" title="Display Quality: HDR quality with a chunky notch"></a><strong>Display Quality: HDR quality with a chunky notch</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 has a 5.84-inch screen with a resolution of 2160 x 1090, laid out as a tall, narrow display with an aspect ratio of 19:9. It has a chunky notch at the top for the front-facing camera and pleasantly rounded edges. The viewing angles are excellent, and the screen is bright enough to see in direct sunlight.</p><p> The display makes use of Nokia’s PureDisplay technology, which means it conforms to the HDR10 industry standard. In practical terms, that means you get an HDR-quality display on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >mid-range phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is pretty fantastic. It’s also capable of converting standard dynamic range content to HDR, which just makes everything look nicer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z-CxaDLaus-Tzpvo30-F2j8i94o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_6-9eeeb5e2962c47e29b8a5335d69cc004.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080328/19272" target="_top" id="2080328">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080328" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080328/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> The only problem with the Nokia 7.1’s display is that the color temperature is extremely cool. If you hold it next to any similar phone, you’ll notice a somewhat bluish tinge. The phone does include a “night mode” feature that tints the display in increasingly strong shades of amber after the sun goes down, which can help with eye strain at night. But if you’re sensitive to blue light, you may have trouble with this display.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Loud-no-distortion-but-a-lack-of-bass-response"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Loud-no-distortion-but-a-lack-of-bass-response" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Loud, no distortion, but a lack of bass response"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Loud, no distortion, but a lack of bass response</strong></h2><p> At the bottom of the Nokia 7.1’s aluminum body, you’ll find the microphone, a USB-C port, and two small rectangular cutouts. That’s where the sound comes from, and despite there being two cutouts, it’s all provided by a single driver.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a powerhouse, but it offers great performance compared to a lot of other mid-range handsets.</p><p> The speaker is serviceable, and we didn’t notice too much distortion when streaming music at high volumes. There is very little bass response though, even compared to other mid-range handsets. The speaker is there if you need it, but you’ll want to plug in headphones or use an external speaker whenever possible. The Nokia 7.1 does includes a headphone jack, located on the top edge of the device, and comes with a pair of earbuds in the box.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036501/19272" target="_top" id="2036501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036501/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Video-Quality-Surprisingly-competent-camera"><a href="#Camera-Video-Quality-Surprisingly-competent-camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera&#x2F;Video Quality: Surprisingly competent camera"></a><strong>Camera&#x2F;Video Quality: Surprisingly competent camera</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 has two rear-facing cameras, 12 MP and 5 MP respectively.

The lenses are housed in a bump protrusion, outlined by the same shining metal seen on the edges of the phone.</p><p> The camera performs well in a range of lighting situations, and Nokia’s camera app provides you with a pro mode that allows you to manually control aspects like white balance and ISO.</p><p> One issue to keep in mind is that when you take a picture with the Nokia 7.1 and view it on the handset, you’re looking at an HDR-enhanced display that upscales regular photos and video with an HDR look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VI32Dr6kjQKlJti1W9Egtq7kb10=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_2-b7780c375da34f349ba0c037120ee3ff.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4d-M-nqoc9xpcT44HdNVobPQU1U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gs9-photo9-7b35a0c91bd544ae89dab81238efdda2.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1 rose photo"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hepqa5K_YkbwuC1_7lRbkLgxJVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/cat-photo7-e1f061ad95324519a4cd85a39faeb1a7.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1 cat photo"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><p> This means a photo that looks fantastic on the phone may look washed out or less clear when viewed on another device. The camera is capable of taking great snaps, but it’s important to keep that in mind. If you want your pictures to look as brilliant on your computer as they do on your phone, you’ll have to make some image adjustments after the fact.</p><p> The handset also supports the “bothie” feature that Nokia has been pushing. This feature enables you to take photos or videos with the front-facing and rear-facing cameras at the same time (if that’s something you ever felt the need to do). It also has a very competent Bokeh feature that holds your subject in sharp focus while blurring the background.</p><p> The hardware just isn’t there to challenge the best phone cameras found in flagship devices from the likes of Samsung, Apple, or Google, but the Nokia 7.1 doesn’t come with a flagship price tag either.</p><h2 id="Battery-Enough-to-last-through-the-work-day"><a href="#Battery-Enough-to-last-through-the-work-day" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Enough to last through the work day"></a><strong>Battery: Enough to last through the work day</strong></h2><p> In our testing, we found the battery life to be somewhat lacking. We subjected the Nokia 7.1 to PCMark’s Work 2.0 battery test, which is designed to simulate constant web browsing and other tasks, and the battery petered out after about seven hours.</p><p> In regular use, we found that the battery was able to stand up to a full day of phone calls, emails, and some light web browsing, video streaming, and playing music.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cD8xK_vs2o2eQxdv-D11RS_1jhE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_5-e19cf3cd1c1f41f69279dbbcf965caf3.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> If you’re a heavier user, you may need to find a charger at some point during the day, but even lighter users would be well advised to plug in at night. You’re unlikely to get multiple days out of a single charge unless you barely use the device at all.</p><p> Charging is accomplished through USB-C, and it does support fast charging when you use the included charger and cable. Despite the glass back, wireless charging is not supported.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134242/18498" target="_top" id="2134242">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134242" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134242/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Android-One-means-guaranteed-updates"><a href="#Software-Android-One-means-guaranteed-updates" class="headerlink" title="Software: Android One means guaranteed updates"></a><strong>Software: Android One means guaranteed updates</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 ships with the Android Pie OS. It’s also an Android One phone, which means you get stock Android and not a whole lot else. In fact, Nokia’s custom camera app is the only non-standard software that you’ll find on the device when you first turn it on.</p><p> Since this handset is part of the Android One program, you can expect updates for at least 24 months from the date of release. Android One phones are also supposed to receive new operating system updates and access to new features before other phones.</p><p> With Google ending their own mid-range line of phones with the Nexus 5X and 6P, Android One devices like the Nokia 7.1 are now the best way to keep up with the newest Android features without paying a premium.</p><h2 id="Price-Solidly-mid-range"><a href="#Price-Solidly-mid-range" class="headerlink" title="Price: Solidly mid-range"></a><strong>Price: Solidly mid-range</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset in terms of price, but it packs a lot of features that you’d expect from a much more expensive phone. It retails for $349 which, in the world of ever-expanding handset price tags, almost borders on the budget category. For what you get in terms of style, specifications, and features, that’s a pretty good deal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Stacks-up-well-against-the-competition"><a href="#Competition-Stacks-up-well-against-the-competition" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Stacks up well against the competition"></a><strong>Competition: Stacks up well against the competition</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 has specs and performance that are more or less in line with flagship phones from the recent past and stacks up very favorably against contemporary mid-range phones. For example, the Motorola One retails at $399 and has a lower resolution display, a less competent camera, and an older, slower processor.</p><p> That processor, the Snapdragon 625, is even older and slower than the Snapdragon 630 found in the budget-priced Nokia 6.1. It’s also about 40 percent slower than the Nokia 7.1’s own Snapdragon 636.</p><p> The display and camera found in the Nokia 7.1 are also significantly better than those found in other handsets in this price range.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 doesn’t compare as favorably to higher-end phones like the $549 OnePlus 6T, which blows it out of the water in both benchmark and real-world testing. But the Nokia 7.1 doesn’t come with that premium price tag, either.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Premium features and great looks, all on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a high-end device, but it brings a lot of premium quality and features to the table. If you’re in the market for a solid mid-range handset, you won’t do much better than this.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oneplus-6t-phone-review-4589385" >OnePlus 6T <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nokia-6-1-review-4689956" >Nokia 6.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/motorola-moto-g6-review-4689366" >Motorola Moto G6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  7.1</li><li>Product Brand  Nokia</li><li>Price  $349.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.9 x 2.8 x 0.4 in.</li><li>Color  6291898</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android Pie</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon 636</li><li>GPU  Adreno 509</li><li>RAM  3 GB</li><li>Storage  32 GB or 64 GB</li><li>Display  5.84 inches</li><li>Camera  12 MP rear, 5 MP front-facing</li><li>Battery Capacity  3,060 mAh</li><li>Ports  USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-the-rotation-revelation-manual-transform-your-visual-content-on-social-media-sites-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Rotation Revelation Manual Transform Your Visual Content on Social Media Sites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-future-shooting-gear-ideal-cameras-musical-videography/"><u>[Updated] Future Shooting Gear Ideal Cameras Musical Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-streamlined-processes-from-camera-roll-to-snapchat-posting/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamlined Processes From Camera Roll to Snapchat Posting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/direct-tweeting-to-your-facebook-followers/"><u>Direct Tweeting to Your Facebook Followers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video.techidaily.com/discover-the-latest-from-minisforum-ultraportable-mini-pc-boasting-amd-ryzen-9-and-nvidia-rtx-gaming-performance/"><u>Discover the Latest From Minisforum: Ultraportable Mini PC Boasting AMD Ryzen 9 and NVIDIA RTX Gaming Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/gamers-choice-a-detailed-review-of-the-hp-omen-obelisk-premium-specs-low-cost/"><u>Gamer's Choice: A Detailed Review of the HP OMEN Obelisk – Premium Specs, Low Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-picks-15-innovative-mounts-to-elevate-your-gopro/"><u>In 2024, Expert Picks 15 Innovative Mounts to Elevate Your GoPro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-gold-ed-unmatched-quality-in-aviation-gaming-in-depth-analysis/"><u>Microsoft Flight Simulator X Gold Ed.: Unmatched Quality in Aviation Gaming - In-Depth Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/new-horizons-the-master-plan-for-virtual-habitat-expansion/"><u>New Horizons: The Master Plan for Virtual Habitat Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/rapid-reader-of-windows-photos-and-images/"><u>Rapid Reader of Windows Photos & Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/the-definitive-guide-to-repairing-windows-update-error-0x80244n2c-proven-solutions-applied/"><u>The Definitive Guide to Repairing Windows Update Error 0X80244n2c - Proven Solutions Applied</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-dynamic-shift-from-traditional-to-modern-reviewing-spider-man-miles-morales/"><u>The Dynamic Shift From Traditional to Modern: Reviewing Spider-Man: Miles Morales</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The game begins with the character you’ll play as waking up in a panic. Someone will narrate everything that’s going on to you, including what the area around you looks like. After a short introduction, you’ll be prompted to pick what you want to play as: Glaive, Jack, or Nano. These will roughly translate into someone more physical, someone mixed physical and magical, and a mage, but of course, set in this strange half-fantastical, half-science-fiction world where everything is new and unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/b1_d8ikgtdkSH_Y0F510q_BXpK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-03-d99b43959fa74b31a15f336852f14d75.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> This whole introduction is slow moving and boring, and getting through it is rough. But even past this, things don’t necessarily pick up and get more interesting. The game has such a heavy hand with its narration, telling you the game’s visuals even though you can see them right there on your screen. The whole game reads like someone wrote a novel, couldn’t publish it, and then decided making a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was a better idea, and instead of trimming the fat, they left every unnecessary description and detail in the game’s prompt.</p><p> I did continue forward, even though I was already disinterested, hoping the game would become more gripping. After the memory room, you’ll wake to another platform where a being tells you you’ve suffered a great injury and they are in your mind. He tries to explain who you are but before he gets too far, you’ll be attacked by something called the Sorrow. Eventually, you’ll wake in the real world, enter the game’s main city, and be able to talk to the wealth of characters living there. You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><p> You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort"><a href="#Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort"></a><strong>Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort</strong></h2><p> The Tides of Numenera is a third-person<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-offline-rpg-games-4177675" >role-playing game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where almost 75 percent of the gameplay is scrolling dialogue boxes and the various prompts that will pop up as the game tells you the story. These prompts will allow you control over how the story unfolds, and this, more than anything else, is the game’s main mechanic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8H4QhkgilcsrFlNL40KO1tDnKvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-02-cca6ebdc67d6477ab973b796fb7e773c.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016165/19272" target="_top" id="2016165">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016165" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016165/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> Beyond this, the other major gameplay mechanic is a system of effort and inspiration. Every action you take will prompt you to use effort. This effort allows for your character to work harder at the chosen action, and thus gives your character a better chance of accomplishing their goal.</p><p> This system is set in place in an attempt to allow you some control over which tasks you want to prioritize with effort―but understand that a lot of the game is built around failure. The game even tells you as much in the introduction. Failing doesn’t mean you’ve messed up, it just means you’ll be set on a different course of the game’s story. Really, I never felt this mechanic offered more than giving players a false sense of control. In reality, the effort prompts didn’t feel like they added much to the overall gameplay experience, they certainly didn’t add any much needed excitement.</p><p> Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> The inspiration aspect is probably the game’s most interesting gameplay mechanic. While you are exploring the world and speaking to characters, you’ll sway them depending on the various prompts. This alignment system will affect the story and what prompts become available for your character. Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> Overall, this game was a weak attempt at offering players the experience of a novel in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> format. The storytelling is very heavy-handed. The writing is weak and full of repeated telling of things you can easily see on-screen around you. There’s little to no direction about where to go or what exactly you should be doing, and combined with the long paragraphs of text, things becomes boring fast. The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way. It’s just a shame that it gets buried under such heavy, inactive storytelling.</p><p> The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated and simplistic"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated and simplistic</strong></h2><p> Tides of Numenera was created in 2017―however, you wouldn’t know this if you jumped into the game and made a guess based upon the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optimizing-video-game-frame-rates-811784" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The graphics look more like they’re stuck in the early 2000s, with blocky, almost pixelated characters. There is some forgiveness to be had because the game isn’t focused on the visuals―it’s more about the words and the story. But there is a limit to how forgiving one can be considering the game isn’t that old.</p><p> The one positive is the originality in the world the developers have created. The setting feels unique―a mix of strange alien tech within a fantasy city. A wide range of characters will fill the game, and they respond and react in creative ways. It’s also a fun experience to run around and talk to these various characters and explore the game’s world and the lore of Numenera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DfXjCwwtXMVBL58JZmix5sR3vBQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-04-7f9c8617b9cd41738ad2ac02abf0aec9.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134496/18498" target="_top" id="2134496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134496/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story"><a href="#Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story" class="headerlink" title="Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story"></a><strong>Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story</strong></h2><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is still an expensive game, costing $50 on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-steam-games-4176308" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it’s not on sale. It’s a game created with a very specific type of player in mind―and I suspect most people are not going to like it.</p><p> That said, if role-playing games with a text-heavy focus are of interest to you, then the game does have a lot to offer for the cost. The world of Numenera is vast, and considering all the prompts that alter the story, the game also has a lot of replayability. While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else, and for those players, the $50 cost will be worth it.</p><p> While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs"><a href="#Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other story focused RPGs"></a><strong>Competition: Other story focused RPGs</strong></h2><p> There are quite a few other games available that are story-focused RPGs besides Tides of Numenera. Wasteland 2 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Wasteland-2-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-4/dp/B013CQHQFU/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a very similar game, as it is made by the same developers, but where Numenera falls flat with its heavy-handed storytelling, Wasteland 2 stands apart with a fun, tactical combat system.</p><p> Another third-person RPG that will have a great and well-developed world to explore is Pillars of Eternity (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Pillars-Eternity-Complete-PlayStation-4/dp/B0734T77S2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). The game will allow you to explore a rich fantasy world and its huge dungeon, and while still rich in story, won’t bog you down to the point of boredom. The last game I’ll recommend looking at is any of the Mass Effect titles. Mass Effect does a great job of building a rich science-fiction world while also giving the player a story filled story-altering choices and decisions.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A text-heavy RPG that doesn’t live up to its predecessor.</strong></p><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is a role-playing game focused on creating an experience that is more novel than video game. The storytelling is text heavy, but the world is rich and unique, mixing sci-fi and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the unique world wasn’t enough to carry me through the outdated graphics and boring gameplay.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Torment: Tides of Numenera</li><li>Product Brand  inXile Entertainment</li><li>Price  $49.99</li><li>ESRB Rating  M for Mature</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, MaxOS,Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-optimizing-performance-a-deep-dive-into-streamlabs-obs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Optimizing Performance A Deep Dive Into Streamlabs OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-11-tools-for-perfecting-your-fb-profile-pics/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Best 11 Tools For Perfecting Your FB Profile Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-sphere-of-imaging-who-takes-the-crown/"><u>[Updated] Sphere of Imaging Who Takes the Crown?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-and-proficiently-implementing-cc-rights/"><u>[Updated] Understanding and Proficiently Implementing CC Rights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/all-inclusive-review-unleash-the-potential-with-the-poweradd-pilot-pro2-charger-for-laptops-and-more/"><u>All-Inclusive Review: Unleash the Potential with the POWERADD Pilot Pro2 Charger for Laptops and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-contacts-from-moto-g14-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to recover deleted contacts from Moto G14.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-microphone-problems-with-the-corsair-hs-series-for-windows-users/"><u>How to Resolve Microphone Problems with the Corsair HS Series for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/nikon-z7-unveiled-a-mirrorless-marvel-of-photographic-prowess/"><u>Nikon Z7 Unveiled: A Mirrorless Marvel of Photographic Prowess</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/regularly-back-up-wallet-data-and-store-private-keys-securely-offline-to-prevent-unauthorized-access/"><u>Regularly Back up Wallet Data and Store Private Keys Securely Offline to Prevent Unauthorized Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/rotibox-wireless-beanie-hat-evaluation-unveiling-the-perfect-mix-of-comfort-and-sound-quality/"><u>Rotibox Wireless Beanie Hat Evaluation: Unveiling the Perfect Mix of Comfort & Sound Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/sound-sovereign-review-of-high-fidelity-plug-ins/"><u>Sound Sovereign: Review of High-Fidelity Plug Ins</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/streamlined-home-connectivity-a-comprehensive-review-of-the-tp-link-deco-p9-mesh-router/"><u>Streamlined Home Connectivity: A Comprehensive Review of the TP-Link Deco P9 Mesh Router</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/top-rated-windows-11-apps-for-high-quality-flac-file-streaming-number-one-selection/"><u>Top-Rated Windows 11 Apps for High-Quality FLAC File Streaming: Number One Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/unlocking-audacitys-full-potential-for-professional-audio/"><u>Unlocking Audacity's Full Potential for Professional Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-features-of-the-samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-why-its-a-hit-amongst-5g-enthusiasts/"><u>Unveiling the Best Features of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE - Why It's a Hit Amongst 5G Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-nokia-71-an-in-depth-look-at-its-vibrant-screen-and-phenomenal-photography-abilities-without-breaking-the-bank/"><u>Unveiling the Nokia 7.1: An In-Depth Look at Its Vibrant Screen & Phenomenal Photography Abilities Without Breaking The Bank</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/1726030501995-vlc/"><u>VLCで再生問題が発生したら、動画フォーマットを確認する方法</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Compatible with Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10, Vista, XP, 2000 and macOS, this modem can work with just about any computer. It also is compatible with most cable internet providers, including Comcast Xfinity, Time Warner Cable, Charter, Cox and more.</p><p> It does not, however, work with bundled voice services that some people still use with cable bundles. When it comes to raw functionality, the CM500 can support 16 downloads and four uploads simultaneously. It can support HD and 4K video streaming, too. And all of this comes in at an affordable price that will save you money on a monthly rental.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137229/26400" target="_top" id="2137229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137229/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Cable-Modem"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Cable-Modem" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Cable Modem"></a>What to Look For in a Cable Modem</h2><p> The world is becoming increasingly connected, and ensuring you have a decent connection in your home is more important than ever. Not only does that mean ensuring you’re subscribed to a fast internet service, but you also have the proper hardware to provide a fast and stable connection whenever needed.</p><p> A home internet network has two main components:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-modem-and-router-4159854" >a modem and a router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The modem converts a cable signal from your internet service provider (ISP) into something a digital device like a computer can understand. The router then distributes that signal to the computers and other connected devices in your home, either via<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338" >wired Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> connections or by beaming it out over Wi-Fi, which is how you get wireless internet connectivity in your home.</p><p> Of course, there are many things to consider when buying a modem. You don’t always need to buy a modem, as you can typically rent one directly from your ISP, although if you do the math, you’ll likely find it makes more financial sense to buy your own. Then, you’ll need to consider whether you want a modem&#x2F;router combo and what features you want from your modem—including what modern connection protocols it supports, the number of channels it offers, and how quickly it can upload and download files.</p><p> Whether you think you know everything you need to or are starting from scratch, here are all the features you should remember while buying a modem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1SZf8UwoZuAHJOglWXBzaJfrml8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-2-5bacf868c9e77c002c9555f3.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135315/14409" target="_top" id="2135315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135315/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="When-Should-You-Rent-Your-Cable-Modem"><a href="#When-Should-You-Rent-Your-Cable-Modem" class="headerlink" title="When Should You Rent Your Cable Modem?"></a>When Should You Rent Your Cable Modem?</h3><p> Before diving into the features to consider when buying a modem, it’s worth considering the possibility of renting one from your ISP. The modems on offer by ISPs are generally decent in quality (though not as good as the modems you can buy), plus going with a rental saves you from doing the legwork of finding one on your own. Further, if anything goes wrong with your cable modem, your ISP will take responsibility for fixing or replacing it, often even sending a technician to your home to take care of everything for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9DXQaEhGunRAssafYX-TGybEsSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear-Nighthawk-C7000-5x4-465340ea47c74a319d9e8ae148401aeb.jpg"                      alt="Netgear-Nighthawk C7000"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144288/7443" target="_top" id="2144288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144288/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Generally, though, we recommend against renting a modem from your ISP. Since the rental often comes out to between $10 and $15 per month, you can save a lot of money by purchasing your own. For example, buying a modem&#x2F;router combo for just $75 can quickly recoup your costs in less than a year.</p><p> That doesn’t mean that there aren’t situations in which you should rent a modem. For starters, if you’re not very tech-savvy or don’t like troubleshooting problems, renting a modem may be the way to go, as you’ll often get complete repair services from your ISP.</p><p> For most, we recommend buying your modem. You’ll get much more control over your home network, and after a few years, you’ll have recouped the cost of the devices you would have otherwise had to rent. There’s no need to worry about hardware problems either since they are rare among the more well-known brands, and all come with a standard warranty.  </p><h3 id="Compatibility-with-Your-ISP"><a href="#Compatibility-with-Your-ISP" class="headerlink" title="Compatibility with Your ISP"></a>Compatibility with Your ISP</h3><p> There are other advantages to buying your modem. For starters, the modems you can rent from your ISP are usually on the older side and may not offer as fast or stable of a connection as you could get with something more modern. Most of the time, ISP modems lack features, preventing you from getting much control over your home network, which might be vital if you want to tweak your network’s settings.</p><p> Before buying a modem, it’s worth double-checking that the modem you’re interested in is compatible with your ISP. Unfortunately, not all modems are supported by every ISP. Most ISPs will have a list of compatible modems on their website, or, at the very least, you should be able to contact customer service to find out.</p><p> If you subscribe to voice services from your ISP, such as Xfinity from Comcast Internet with Voice, you must ensure that the cable modem you purchase supports your provider’s voice services. While it’s theoretically possible to run your old voice-capable cable modem in parallel with a newer, high-performance modem, this can get messy and needs to be supported in some cases. Besides, the main point of buying a cable modem is that you don’t have to keep paying rental fees for the old one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mczhPmklHisJ3nV93MiYFCIrGPA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-4-5bacf875c9e77c0025819a90.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700 combo"                ></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1?<br> DOCSIS, a short form for “Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification,” is the technology on which all cable modems are based. DOCSIS 3.0 is the standard currently being used by almost all cable providers, but even though it offers theoretical speeds of up to 1Gbps, most ISPs in the U.S. don’t go beyond 600Mbps over DOCSIS 3.0. You’ll need a DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem to get actual multi-gigabit plans. Don’t worry if your ISP doesn’t support the newer standard yet, though, as all DOCSIS 3.1 modems are fully backward compatible with DOCSIS 3.0, so you can buy one now to be ready when those faster speeds do come along.</li><li>What happens if your cable modem breaks down?<br> While it’s true that one of the advantages of renting your cable modem from your ISP is they’ll easily swap it out if you have any problems—something that won’t be an option if you’ve bought your own—the reality is that modern cable modems are very reliable as long as you go with a trusted brand, and almost all of them also come with 1–2 year warranties.</li><li>What about cable modem&#x2F;router combos?<br> If you’re in the market for a new wireless router, it might be worth considering a cable modem&#x2F;router combo instead since you’ll get the best of both worlds in a much more affordable package. There’s rarely any good reason to go that route if you’re pleased with the Wi-Fi router you already have, though any cable modem should work just fine with any relatively modern router.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-vhs-80s-effects-to-use-in-video-editing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Best VHS 80S Effects to Use in Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-innovative-social-networking-sites-that-challenge-tiktoks-dominance/"><u>[New] In 2024, Innovative Social Networking Sites That Challenge TikTok's Dominance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-a-detailed-study-of-vsdcs-screen-capture-prowess-and-competing-products-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Detailed Study of VSDC's Screen Capture Prowess & Competing Products for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/delve-into-advanced-acoustic-technology-discover-klipschs-flexus-200-soundbar/"><u>Delve Into Advanced Acoustic Technology - Discover Klipsch's Flexus 200 Soundbar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-on-the-potent-beatit-bt-d11-jump-starter-capabilities/"><u>Expert Analysis on the Potent Beatit BT-D11 Jump Starter Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-bytes.techidaily.com/gratitude-and-confirmation-successful-completion-of-your-mirillis-product-acquisition/"><u>Gratitude and Confirmation: Successful Completion of Your Mirillis Product Acquisition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-google-pixel-7a-location-on-twitter-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change your Google Pixel 7a Location on Twitter | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-and-tricks-for-apple-id-locked-issue-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Tips and Tricks for Apple ID Locked Issue On Apple iPhone 11 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/my-videos-arent-playing-on-tecno-camon-20-what-can-i-do-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>My Videos Arent Playing on Tecno Camon 20 – What Can I Do? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/netflixs-true-worth-top-5-attributes-explored/"><u>Netflix's True Worth: Top 5 Attributes Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/staying-powered-up-for-gaming-why-this-apc-ups-is-a-must-have/"><u>Staying Powered Up for Gaming: Why This APC UPS Is a Must-Have</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/superior-ssd-performance-reviewed-for-ps5/"><u>Superior SSD Performance Reviewed for PS5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/tango-free-text-voice-and-video-calls/"><u>Tango - Free Text, Voice and Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-10-pc-improvements-you-cant-miss/"><u>Top 10 PC Improvements You Can't Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-apple-watch-series-6-refined-improvements-maintaining-market-leadership/"><u>Unveiling the Apple Watch Series 6: Refined Improvements Maintaining Market Leadership</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The Switch is one of Nintendo’s best-selling devices ever, despite hardware that lags behind the competition in terms of power. The Switch Lite builds on that success with similar hardware, complete compatibility, and an even more portable form factor.</p><p> Where the original Switch is a hybrid portable console, the Switch Lite is a more traditional handheld gaming device. It still provides most of the best features of the full-sized Switch, but it’s also Nintendo’s only pure portable since the discontinuation of the 3DS family of handhelds.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EUqklfDyxuB1ye8-DBboDrjzkUw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-2-225f5107c7b74f159afecba8c3f6174a.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997662/19272" target="_top" id="1997662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997662/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Cute-and-compact"><a href="#Design-Cute-and-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Cute and compact"></a><strong>Design: Cute and compact</strong></h2><p> It’s hard not to swoon at the sight of the Switch Lite. The handheld console is cute and compact, featuring unique color options, bright white buttons, and joysticks wrapped around a downsized screen. The whole unit is about the size of a beefy phablet. The screen alone is about the size of an iPhone SE.</p><p> Compared to its larger cousin, this device is light and slim, with a smooth matte surface that spills across the entire unit in a beautiful, uninterrupted fashion. Whereas the regular Switch creates a stark contrast between each Joy-Con and the console, the Lite is one continuous body that creates a sleeker look and sturdier feel.</p><p> Looking at both Switches side-by-side, the Lite isn’t massively smaller in comparison, but it seems that way when you swap between the two. The reduction in size and weight doesn’t make it challenging to use for those with larger hands.</p><p> The screen has been decreased from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches, still sporting the same plastic overlay above it (meaning you’ll want to get a glass protector to prevent scratches), and the length and height have been trimmed down a good bit. The most obvious change here is the overall length of the Lite, which is slimmer by roughly the size of an entire Joy-Con on one side.</p><p> The smaller size is because the regular Switch has removable controllers, and the Lite does not. The compromise on its size is that you can’t take your Joy-Cons off and instantly start playing a local multiplayer game. Although that might be disappointing for some, the Lite now feels much better for long handheld gaming sessions when compared to the bulkier model.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p> Aside from the lack of removable controllers, the Lite features the same layout as the Joy-Con inputs, down to the spacing and functions. On the left are two shoulder buttons, a minus button (select), a joystick, a directional pad, and a screenshot button. The right side is mostly the same, with two more shoulders, a plus button (start), four inputs, another joystick, and a home button.</p><p> The only real notable difference here is that Nintendo has opted for a traditional D-pad, which is leagues better than the old layout for platformers, fighting games, and pretty much everything else. This distinction is, of course, because you’ll no longer be removing the left controller and requiring it to function as a separate device.</p><p> The top is home to the power button and volume toggle, a vent, a 3.5mm jack, and the game card slot, while the bottom holds the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> input for power and the addition of a new standalone SD card slot.</p><p> Where there’s usually a kickstand on the Switch with a hidden SD card slot, this version drops that option (since you can no longer remove the Joy-Con for tabletop mode) and adds a small door for expanding your storage. The kickstand was flimsy anyway, so you likely won’t miss it.</p><p> There’s still the issue with the USB-C port sticking straight out of the bottom, making it hard to sit flat against something, but this is somewhat less annoying since you’ll likely be holding it while gaming. Unfortunately, the Lite does not fit into the dock that came with a Switch. If you want to charge it, you have to plug it directly into the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-c-chargers-4155815" >USB-C charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the one on a regular Switch, as they’re the same.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7502vZ1Vh2D4nRux6hEnq4BL3Rk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-5-2fb7aa309cc54dd79c07bd799ef7fe84.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch"><a href="#Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Hit the switch"></a><strong>Setup Process: Hit the switch</strong></h2><p> If you’ve set up a previous Switch console in the past, the process here is mostly the same, but it’s even easier since there are no Joy-Cons.</p><p> Since the Lite is exclusively handheld, there’s no dock to worry about here, but make sure your console has enough juice before beginning setup. Setup starts with pushing the power button on the top and is facilitated by an on-screen guide that helps you set up the usual stuff like Wi-Fi, account creation (or login), etc. When complete, either pop in a game card or download one digitally to begin gaming.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> When you link your Nintendo account during setup, you can choose which Switch you want to be your primary system and which will be your secondary. That means that Nintendo essentially makes you decide to set up the Switch Lite as a secondary system that can only play your games while logged in and connected to Wi-Fi, or you can transfer the old Switch’s data to the new one.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> If you opt to make your Lite the secondary, you can kiss goodbye to playing any of your digital games on the go unless you have stable Wi-Fi on hand. Because of this, I decided to make my docked Switch the secondary (since it is always at home with Wi-Fi access).</p><p> While this does solve most of the issues, it’s annoying that it forces you to choose. Other systems, like Xbox, only allow one “home” console to play your games without being logged in, but it’s less of an issue since those consoles aren’t portable.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap). However, none of this data migration will happen automatically like other gaming consoles. You’ll need to manually download your saves locally each time and then update them on the console you want to use, even with the cloud option.</p><p> Sure, all of this does work, but it’s a pain to do and feels like another shortsighted attempt from Nintendo in a world where other competitors are leagues ahead. With other consoles and PC platforms like Steam, your saved data syncs to the cloud automatically, allowing you to play wherever you want without worrying about losing progress.</p><p> There’s yet another issue if you have kids or multiple accounts on your Switches. Since one Switch is now set as your primary, other users can’t access all your games from a secondary console.</p><p> For example, if you set the Switch Lite as your primary system, nobody can play games you’ve bought and downloaded on your home Switch unless they log into your account. You could always keep that other Switch as your primary, but then your Switch Lite will need Wi-Fi to access titles. It’s easy to see the problem there, but apparently, Nintendo doesn’t.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kQx9K3tATPBWAMgyJJymqBqYPao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-3-7349fa7d79f34dbaa50c25cb59aec820.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075483/7443" target="_top" id="2075483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD"><a href="#Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD"></a><strong>Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD</strong></h2><p> Much like the original Switch, the Lite is by no means a powerhouse console sporting top-of-the-line graphics and hardware. That said, it doesn’t necessarily need to be. The Switch Lite performs similarly to its larger counterpart while in handheld mode, but let’s delve into specifics.</p><p> Sporting the same custom Tegra X1 from Nvidia, the Switch Lite has plenty of CPU and GPU power for its humble needs. The screen maxes out at a 720p resolution, which isn’t great but gets the job done on such a small screen. Since you can’t use the Switch Lite with a dock, there’s no way to play in 1080p.</p><p> Although the screen is reduced from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches on the Lite, I didn’t notice a big difference. The Lite’s display packs more pixels per inch (PPI) at 267 PPI compared to the original Switch’s 236 PPI. The display looks sharper, but with such a marginal difference, most won’t notice much.</p><p> I’ve played many games on the Switch Lite, including modern classics like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-4685759" >The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pokémon Let’s Go, and Shovel Knight. All these had a solid performance from the console, with no considerable dips in frames, hiccups, or freezes.</p><p> Like its predecessor’s mobile mode, the Switch Lite is unfortunately capped at 30 FPS for many titles (though it can hit 60 in some single-player games). Unlike the Switch, which you can dock to boost performance, you’re stuck with the handheld specs on the Lite.</p><p> A quick example is that single-player Mario Kart 8 Deluxe runs at a smooth 60 FPS in 1080p on a docked Switch but 720p at 60 FPS in the handheld mode. Adding more players reduces your frames to 30 FPS, which is also true for Smash Bros. The Switch Lite isn’t designed for single-device multiplayer, though, and you’re unlikely to get three or more players all crouched behind the 5.5-inch screen anyway.</p><p> These somewhat disappointing performance numbers look bad compared to a home console but remember that this is a handheld console that you can play for hours on end without needing a power cable.</p><p> If you’re like me and love to use the previous Switch in handheld mode for single-player games, the Lite will quickly become your go-to Switch for this particular setting. I’d even argue that this is perhaps the ideal way you should use it.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap).</p><p> Since the Switch Lite doesn’t have detachable Joy-Cons, you’ll need to bring an extra controller if you want to play local multiplayer games on the go. It works the same way as the original console, but it’s far less practical on the Lite since you can’t dock it, it doesn’t have a kickstand, you need separate controllers, and the screen is smaller. The option is there if you want, but this isn’t the Switch for you if you want to do local multiplayer.</p><p> Online multiplayer does, however, work pretty well. Boot up a game like Super Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., or your favorite free-to-play shooter and connect to the internet just like you would on the original Switch. For most matchmaking, however, you’ll need to pick up Nintendo’s online subscription service<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> This service is inexpensive at just $20 a year (or $35 a year for a family plan that allows up to eight users, also available at $4 a month), but many remain frustrated with its capabilities. It includes cool perks, like access to a growing library of NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games, the Nintendo Switch Online smartphone app, Save Data Cloud, and special offers for members.</p><p> Once again, there’s no Ethernet port, so you can stick with Wi-Fi and hope for the best or grab an aftermarket adapter, which is far less practical on the Lite, seeing how it’s handheld only.</p><p> Online games have worked well for me, despite needing to rely on Wi-Fi. However, Nintendo’s online service is still far behind the likes of Sony or Microsoft, and the lack of a wired connection means you may run into issues with speed and stability if your Wi-Fi isn’t great.</p><p> Frustrations like the lack of in-game chat cripple the Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo has done little to address these issues. Many functions still require you to use the app on your smartphone (like online voice chat), and while Xbox and PlayStation users get free games for their consoles as part of their subscription services, Switch users only get older virtual console games.</p><p> All said and done, the performance is excellent for single-player experiences on the Switch Lite, with online multiplayer trailing behind but perfectly functional. Local multiplayer is easily one of the biggest strengths of the original Switch and our favorite aspect. However, the methods used to create a more portable console with the Lite also severely hurt its viability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KxMaFgooi4rm3qbImmLKatuUtVI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-4-ef84dbbbde3d48ff97515e5c6b9981a4.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy"><a href="#Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy"></a><strong>Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy</strong></h2><p> If you’ve got an older Switch already or at least spent some time with one, the software found on the Switch Lite is exactly the same. Thankfully, that means it’s clean and snappy, but also a bit boring.</p><p> Booting up your Switch takes you to a quick start screen that allows you to either jump back into your recently used game or go straight to the main home screen by pressing the home button. This home screen provides a horizontal scrolling line of tiles for your games and apps, arranged by what you’ve recently used. Moving down to the lower row provides access to stuff like news, the eShop, screenshots, controller settings or the console’s settings.</p><p> Although you likely won’t be using Joy-Cons too often with the Lite, the bottom right will display your current controller setup so you know what’s connected. There’s also a handy little guide for what buttons you can use to interact with the options on screen. Up top, your profile and friends list can be accessed alongside a clock, a Wi-Fi meter, and a battery gauge.</p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld.</p><p> While the overall UI is quick and navigable, it feels drab. There are still no themes to swap aside from a simple light or dark mode, so don’t get too lofty with your customization ideas.</p><p> The biggest strength of the UI might be that you can use the touchscreen for most functions outside of games. Navigating the screen by tapping elements is even easier than using the controllers, and having an on-screen keyboard means typing out names and info is as easy as texting on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eFyBn6jL7cdHOO4q7zc6pALdQzw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-6-42a5bc5ea4e544bdb6d3fbbd074583c2.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528688/16446" target="_top" id="1528688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528688/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best"><a href="#Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best"></a><strong>Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best</strong></h2><p> Battery life on the original Switch was just okay, to put it lightly, but typically you were lucky to get anything over 3 hours of screen time with most titles. It eventually received a bigger battery in a minor hardware revision, which helped. The Switch Lite has a slightly smaller battery than the revised Switch but also has lower power needs due to its small screen.</p><p> The Lite comes equipped with a 3,570mAh lithium-ion battery (compared to the 4,310mAh on the first Switch) that promises 3 to 7 hours of runtime. That extensive range exists because some activities on the console are far less demanding than others.</p><p> This slight bump in battery life is primarily due to the Switch Lite’s smaller screen, which needs less juice. Charging the battery takes about three hours, but only if you drain it completely. Using it occasionally instead of for extended gaming sessions, I’ve found that I don’t need to charge it that often and that it charges fast when I do.</p><p> Demanding titles like Breath of the Wild will still place you on the shorter end of that battery life spectrum, but I could log about 3.5-4 hours even with Zelda. Indie games and others that are less power-hungry can get you up to 5 hours and above. Note that you can tweak settings like brightness, Wi-Fi, and airplane mode to give even more screen time.</p><p> A portable charger is still one of the best accessories you can pick up for the Switch, and there are many quality options out that are approved by Nintendo. I recommend picking one up, but be careful which one you choose. I’ve stuck with reputable brands and haven’t had any trouble, but I have heard horror stories from people who have bricked their consoles with unsupported options.</p><p> Lastly, the battery is internal, so you can’t easily pop in a new one when it starts to degrade. While I haven’t seen any degradation with mine, it’ll happen at some point. When it does, sending it to Nintendo for repair is the only real option.</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands</strong></h2><p> It’s no surprise that since Nintendo removed many features from the Switch to create the Lite model, the price has also decreased considerably. The Switch is already at a pretty sweet price of $300, so how does the Lite stack up?</p><p> The Switch Lite has an MSRP of $200, which is a pretty good value. It plays all the same games as the original Switch at a significantly lower price and is much more portable. You do lose the ability to dock it; for some people, that feature will be worth the extra $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7XA6hgAK2B4hDSlWdmB8VQddrjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-7-Comparison-44dcf88ec51247a2b0756445a3c7884d.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075462/7443" target="_top" id="2075462">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075462" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075462/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch"></a><strong>Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch</strong></h2><p> The biggest competitor to the Switch Lite is the original Switch. Nintendo has done an excellent job with both of these devices, but they each have some strengths and weaknesses you should consider before buying.</p><p> The first thing to consider is whether you want to play couch co-op or versus with your friends. If you plan to use your Switch primarily for playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch. You need the original Switch to play on a larger screen, and it also comes with two Joy-Cons that you can use as separate controllers.</p><p> Even if you wanted to play with one other person locally on your Switch Lite, you’d need to spend about $60-70 on some Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller, thus nearly reaching the price of the full-sized console.</p><p> If you plan to use your Switch primarily for stuff like playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch.</p><p> If you feel like you’ll use your Switch away from home, or you’re primarily a solo player who plans to focus on single-player games or online multiplayer, the Switch Lite is equally good here. The main difference is that the Lite can only be used in handheld mode and takes a slight hit in resolution. The strengths of the Switch Lite are that it’s ultra-compact and portable, so if you mainly want something to take with you from place to place, it’s the better bet.</p><p> The Switch Lite also makes a great companion device if you already have a Switch. If you have both, you get the best of both worlds—the Lite’s portability and the regular Switch’s extra features.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Perfect for gamers who prefer handheld.</strong></p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld. It features an extensive library of exclusives that are perfect for a highly mobile system like Animal Crossing—and it’s hard to argue with the price.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-series-s-review-5085770" >Xbox Series S Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >Sony PlayStation 5 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Switch Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Nintendo</li><li>UPC  070004640519</li><li>Price  $199.99</li><li>Weight  9.7 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.6 x 8.2 x 0.55 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year warranty</li><li>CPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>GPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  32GB internal, one micro SD slot (up to 2TB)</li><li>Ports  USB-C, 3.5mm audio jack</li><li>Screen  Multi-touch capacitive touchscreen &#x2F; 5.5-inch LCD Screen &#x2F; 1280 x 720</li><li>Battery  Lithium-ion battery&#x2F;3570mAh</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-quick-tips-for-high-quality-audio-recordings-on-your-imac-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Quick Tips for High-Quality Audio Recordings on Your iMac for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-excellence-on-your-wrist-comprehensive-review-of-the-xiaomi-mi-smart-band-4/"><u>Affordable Excellence on Your Wrist: Comprehensive Review of the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-quality-with-arcshell-ar-5-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>Affordable Quality with ArcShell AR-5 - A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/capture-moments-on-a-dime-kodaks-fz53-explored/"><u>Capture Moments on a Dime - Kodak's FZ53 Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/efficient-obs-settings-for-thrifty-users-for-2024/"><u>Efficient OBS Settings for Thrifty Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/elevating-your-laptop-experience-a-step-by-step-guide-for-ssd-installation-on-macbook-pro/"><u>Elevating Your Laptop Experience: A Step-by-Step Guide for SSD Installation on MacBook Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/getting-started-with-your-dell-wd19-how-to-downloadinstall-drivers/"><u>Getting Started with Your Dell WD19 - How to Download/Install Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-when-apple-account-locked-from-apple-iphone-13-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Fix when Apple Account Locked From Apple iPhone 13?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-sony-xperia-5-v-without-losing-data-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Reset Sony Xperia 5 V without Losing Data | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-apple-iphone-x-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Apple iPhone X?

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.

It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further. On the other hand, there are other great 65-inch 4K TV models that may not have all the extra features the C9 does, but do have comparable quality without breaking the bank.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948909/19272" target="_top" id="1948909">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948909" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948909/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  OLED C9 65” 4K Smart TV</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>Price  $3,499.00</li><li>Weight  74.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.1 x 33.9 x 9.9 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>TV Weight without Stand  55.6 pounds</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>AI Assistant  Google Assistant and Alexa built in</li><li>Network &amp; Internet Functionality  Internet video playback, WEB browsing</li><li>Connectivity Options  Bluetooth, LAN, Wi-Fi</li><li>Bluetooth Version  Bluetooth 5.0</li><li>Platform  LG ThinQ AI, webOS</li><li>Resolution  3840 x 2160</li><li>Screen Size  65 inches</li><li>Type  OLED</li><li>Refresh Rate  120 Hz</li><li>Display Format  4k UHD (2160p)</li><li>HDR Technology  4K Cinema HDR, Dolby Vision, HDR 10, Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG)</li><li>Ports  4 HDMI 2.1 Ports, 3 USB Ports</li><li>Audio  Dolby Atmos 2.2 Channel 40 Watts</li><li>Additional Audio Features  Bluetooth audio streaming, Intelligent Voice Recognition, LG Sound Sync</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-decoding-aspect-ratios-for-effective-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Decoding Aspect Ratios for Effective YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-boosting-revenue-with-youtube-short-videos-a-complete-plan/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Boosting Revenue with YouTube Short Videos – A Complete Plan</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-nokia-g310-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Complete Guide To OEM Unlocking on Nokia G310</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-critical-look-at-the-avengers-where-marvel-triumphs-meet-unremarkable-moments/"><u>A Critical Look at The Avengers - Where Marvel Triumphs Meet Unremarkable Moments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comparing-smart-speakers-google-nest-audio-vs-apple-homepod-which-wins/"><u>Comparing Smart Speakers: Google Nest Audio Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses roughly the same design as many of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, and it didn’t give the absolute best results either. Nonetheless, it’s still going to be the best choice for a really large segment of buyers out there simply because of how aggressively its priced.</p><p> If you are living inside of a large metropolitan area, you likely don’t need the best possible antenna to pick up the channels being broadcast to you over the air. Furthermore, I didn’t see that big of a difference in performance as price increased. Unless you step it all the way up to a much larger, much more expensive solution, the difference in performance is probably not worth it, which is why the 1byone is an easy recommendation. Let’s see how it performed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FEdsHVNn7IxwxXsSkRT0jxmmRuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_02-d797d473ec154becbab8a3023cff8b53.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Vanilla"><a href="#Design-Vanilla" class="headerlink" title="Design: Vanilla"></a><strong>Design: Vanilla</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna uses a flat rectangular design similar to other powered indoor antennas on the market. The 13.25 x 9.25 inch antenna surface is roughly in line with most of the other products I looked at in this category, the only real difference being that the 1byone has a much more rigid surface.</p><p> Being a powered antenna, the 1byone uses an external amplifier to boost the signal. This box contains a coaxial input attached via the included 16.5ft cable, and has a power input, which can be supplied by the TV itself if it can support USB power. Otherwise, 1byone includes a USB power adapter.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fairly-intuitive"><a href="#Setup-Fairly-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fairly intuitive"></a><strong>Setup: Fairly intuitive</strong></h2><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas. Simply attach the 16.5ft coaxial cable to the external amplifier, connect the power to a USB power source, and then attach the coaxial cable from the amplifier to your TV.</p><p> Setup of the 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna is relatively simple, and more or less in line with what I’ve come to expect from similar powered indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Performance-Good-enough-for-most"><a href="#Performance-Good-enough-for-most" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Good enough for most"></a><strong>Performance: Good enough for most</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna didn’t have the best performance of the antennas we’ve tested, falling somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my channel acquisition test, I averaged 59 channels across all the tests performed. This compares to the worst performing antenna at just 47, and the best at 76.</p><p> This should be more than suitable for most people living within a city in relatively close proximity to the source of the TV signal. As for those living further, your mileage may vary.</p><h2 id="Range-Middle-of-the-road"><a href="#Range-Middle-of-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Range: Middle of the road"></a><strong>Range: Middle of the road</strong></h2><p> 1byone makes no specific promises about the range of their antenna, although they do cite users having positive experiences from as far as 48 miles away in their customer testimonials. Given how many factors impact the effective range, I think it is somewhat wise not to make any promises. Nonetheless, this is clearly a device that will be best suited for people living in or near major metropolitan areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6y-ITpY8n7xf8BteMqdJjYm-paU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7LW4078201-1byOne_TVAntennas_05-178a02351af040cc89c86169b88a6de2.jpg"                      alt="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902324/19272" target="_top" id="1902324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902324/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-great-deal"><a href="#Price-A-great-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great deal"></a><strong>Price: A great deal</strong></h2><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna costs just $25, making it the least expensive option out of the antennas I tested. It picked up all the major channels that I would actually watch, and didn’t have any issues with the signal. So from my perspective, why would I pay more? I think buyers would probably be best served by seeing if an antenna like this works for them. If you discover you need something more substantial, feel free to move on to a pricier option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135357/19272" target="_top" id="2135357">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135357" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135357/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna"><a href="#1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna"></a><strong>1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna vs Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Another popular manufacturer is Mohu, and the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna offers a simpler, non-amplified solution that only loses out on a hair of performance versus the 1byone. I preferred the build quality of the Mohu Leaf, if only marginally, and like the simplicity of not needing additional wires and boxes hanging out of my TV.</p><p> At the end of the day though, the 1byone performs better and costs less money, so it’s not the easiest argument to make.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The overall best value.</strong></p><p> The 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor Antenna offers the best value out of all the indoor antennas that we tested. If you can get the performance you need from the 1byone, it’s the antenna to buy. I wouldn’t consider other options unless you’ve already ruled out this one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115921/19272" target="_top" id="2115921">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115921" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115921/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Amplified Digital HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  1byone</li><li>Price  $25.00</li><li>Release Date  December 2014</li><li>Weight  9.3 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  13.6 x 2 x 10.4 in.</li><li>Color  White</li><li>Powered  Yes</li><li>Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor  Indoor</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ptimal-tripod-setup-for-smooth-professional-videography/"><u>[New] Optimal Tripod Setup for Smooth, Professional Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unlock-the-full-potential-of-zoom-in-your-xbox-setup/"><u>[New] Unlock the Full Potential of Zoom in Your Xbox Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-amplifying-online-videos-best-5-tools-and-tricks/"><u>2024 Approved Amplifying Online Videos Best 5 Tools & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/ace-your-internet-connection-with-the-best-cable-modems-of-202/"><u>Ace Your Internet Connection with the Best Cable Modems of 202</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/all-about-the-samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g-the-ultimate-review-for-next-gen-mobile-lovers/"><u>All About the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G: The Ultimate Review for Next-Gen Mobile Lovers!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/becoming-a-gif-maestro-the-meme-creators-handbook/"><u>Becoming a GIF Maestro The Meme Creator’s Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/determining-your-next-cellphone-upgrade/"><u>Determining Your Next Cellphone Upgrade</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/graphics-legacy-radeon-reloaded-for-2024/"><u>Graphics Legacy Radeon Reloaded for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/grobalization-and-optimization-considering-factors-like-resource-allocation-logistics-and-environmental-impacts-in-a-comprehensive-manner/"><u>Grobalization and Optimization, Considering Factors Like Resource Allocation, Logistics, and Environmental Impacts in a Comprehensive Manner.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/guide-finding-and-installing-the-latest-software-drivers-on-your-hp-envy-20-computer-system/"><u>Guide: Finding & Installing the Latest Software Drivers on Your HP ENVY 20 Computer System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-icloud-by-checkra1n-even-from-iphone-xs-if-youve-tried-everything-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even From iPhone XS If Youve Tried Everything</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/limostudio-lms103-lighting-kit-review-affordable-umbrella-style-lighting/"><u>LimoStudio LMS103 Lighting Kit Review: Affordable Umbrella-Style Lighting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/mastering-windows-error-resolution-0x80072f8f/"><u>Mastering Windows Error Resolution: 0X80072f8f</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/portable-fun-for-less-exploring-the-features-and-performance-of-nintendos-switch-lite/"><u>Portable Fun for Less: Exploring the Features and Performance of Nintendo's Switch Lite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/upgrade-your-computers-sound-free-audio-drivers-for-windows-7/"><u>Upgrade Your Computer's Sound: Free Audio Drivers for Windows 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/upgraded-views-installing-new-laptop-gfx/"><u>Upgraded Views: Installing New Laptop GFX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/win-8-to-win-11-a-comprehensive-upgrade-guide/"><u>Win 8 to Win 11: A Comprehensive Upgrade Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Games like <em>Karateka</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Oregon Trail</em>, and <em>Ultima 1</em> on the Apple II set the standard for high-end gaming in the late 70s and early 80s. By the 90s every major game worth mentioning had a Mac version, and titles like <em>Myst</em> and the <em>Marathon</em> Trilogy by Bungie showed that Mac was a serious gaming platform, even if it only catered to a much smaller segment of the personal computer market than it does today. Heck, the first <em>Halo</em> game was set to be a Mac exclusive, <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/qVMD7wx-peU?si=0rzEBXnRCr8-Njh7" >announced by Steve Jobs himself <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Sure, it was a totally different style of game at that point, but it was still on everyone’s radar.</p><p> From there, the shift to Intel from PowerPC made porting Windows games to Mac easier, but the results weren’t always stellar, and when Apple killed 32-bit app support for macOS Catalina, making most of the Mac back catalog unplayable, it didn’t help. Still, anyone who doesn’t think of the Mac as an important gaming platform has to completely ignore the points in its long existence where it was leading gaming technology or highly influential.</p><h2 id="Apple-Is-Taking-Gaming-Seriously"><a href="#Apple-Is-Taking-Gaming-Seriously" class="headerlink" title="Apple Is Taking Gaming Seriously"></a>Apple Is Taking Gaming Seriously</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/macos_14_Games.png"                      alt="macOS 14 Game Mode cuts latency for AirPods and controllers"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Apple</em></p><p> While Apple may have lost focus on gaming, and its latter Intel-based systems usually lacked the GPU power to play anything well, things are very different now. Thanks to the technology the company developed for iPhone and iPad, and its experience with being a gaming platform there, Apple Silicon is a serious hardware platform for games. Even the lowliest M1 Apple Silicon systems are comparable in performance to the last-generation consoles millions of people are still actively using to this day, and its second and third generation of Apple Silicon chips have raised that floor right into current-generation gaming territory.</p><p> It’s not just the hardware that’s ready to game. Apple has its own API known as Metal, and includes AI-upscaling technology in the form of <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-itel-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >MetalFX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Controller support is universal across macOS and the iOS family. Apple has even created a special porting kit which makes it as easy as possible for developers to port their Windows games to Mac. All the groundwork for an Apple gaming renaissance is in place, now the games have to come.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Developers-Need-to-Take-It-Seriously-and-Some-Are"><a href="#Developers-Need-to-Take-It-Seriously-and-Some-Are" class="headerlink" title="Developers Need to Take It Seriously (and Some Are)"></a>Developers Need to Take It Seriously (and Some Are)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-09-at-11.19.17.png"                      alt="Resident Evil Village Mac Announcement"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Apple</em></p><p> A platform that’s technically ready for gaming is necessary but no sufficient for Mac gaming to be taken seriously. You need the games that people want to play to come to Mac. Apple has put in some effort in this area as well, working with some developers to bring big-name titles such as <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/resident-evil-village-for-mac/id1640627334?mt=12" >Resident Evil 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961" >Death Stranding <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Apple Silicon.</p><p> Even without any prodding from Apple, the <a class="link"   href="https://macdailynews.com/2024/01/10/apples-mac-takes-16-1-share-of-u-s-personal-computer-market-in-q423-gartner/" >rise in computer market share <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Apple has undergone in the past few years is surely attracting the attention of developers who are looking to expand their potential customer base. If you look at the <a class="link"   href="https://thegameawards.com/nominees/game-of-the-year" >2024 Game Awards nominees <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> several of these games have native Mac versions, including <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em>, and <em>Dave the Diver</em>. Perusing Steam on macOS, and you’ll see a long list of new and older games that are either native to Apple Silicon or will run via <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-demystifying-viewer-statistics-on-instagram-images/" >Rosetta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and even the humble <a class="link"   href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-professional-gopro-footage-in-3-simple-steps/" >M1 MacBook Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can run most of these titles well.</p><h2 id="Mac-Owners-Need-to-Spread-the-Word"><a href="#Mac-Owners-Need-to-Spread-the-Word" class="headerlink" title="Mac Owners Need to Spread the Word"></a>Mac Owners Need to Spread the Word</h2><p> If you have a modern M1 Silicon Mac, you should definitely grab a controller, or hook up a decent mouse and see which of the games you already own has a Mac version. You may be surprised at how competent and solid the experience has become. All those MacBook Air owners may have no idea that they have a potent little portable gaming machine in their bag, and if you have one of the higher-end Apple Silicon MacBooks or desktop Macs with more powerful GPUs, you might have a great gaming system right there without knowing it.</p><hr><p> While I still can’t say that anyone should buy a Mac for gaming yet, I can say that if you need a Mac for any other reason, you should definitely try gaming on it, and if you like it, let Apple, developers, and your friends know about it. There’s a chicken-and-egg situation with gaming on Macs where no one will port or make games without demand, and there won’t be demand without people playing games on their Macs. Which means if you’re a gamer and a Mac fan, you need to do your bit to make it more attractive for game developers across the globe.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-dynamic-backdrop-customization-in-teammate-windows-prepost-calls/"><u>[New] In 2024, Dynamic Backdrop Customization in Teammate Windows, Pre/Post Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-seamless-social-integration-twitter-and-facebook-connections/"><u>[New] In 2024, Seamless Social Integration Twitter & Facebook Connections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-instagram-photo-addition-a-simple-guide/"><u>[New] Instagram Photo Addition A Simple Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-the-fabric-of-future-cutting-edge-vr-technology/"><u>[New] The Fabric of Future Cutting-Edge VR Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-compre-written-analysis-hero4-black-operations/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Compre Written Analysis Hero4 Black Operations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-top-10-screenshot-tools-of-2021/"><u>2024 Approved The Top 10 Screenshot Tools of 2021</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/2024s-elite-radio-gadgets-for-police-scenarios/"><u>2024'S Elite Radio Gadgets for Police Scenarios</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-and-compact-brilliance-in-depth-look-at-the-samsung-galaxy-s10e/"><u>Affordable and Compact Brilliance: In-Depth Look at the Samsung Galaxy S10e</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-laptop-ventilation-for-your-device-check-out-the-topmate-c3amator-review/"><u>Affordable Laptop Ventilation for Your Device?

This usually manifests in things like poor battery life, low quality screens, and other concessions.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Acer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has managed to defy that stereotype with the Aspire E 15, which smashes the competition in terms of performance, display quality, battery life, and even includes a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-vga-2626027" >VGA port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for anyone who actually needs one of those.</p><p> We put an Acer Aspire E 15 to the test around the office and out in the world to see how it holds up outside of basic benchmarks. Read on to see how it did.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/urRsU5n3D2A-nzQe6NGdQgrDGwM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-2-4cb96f03e4c748a583d14f0c8c9224dc.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Design-A-decent-plastic-case-but-not-exactly-a-premium-look"><a href="#Design-A-decent-plastic-case-but-not-exactly-a-premium-look" class="headerlink" title="Design: A decent plastic case, but not exactly a premium look"></a><strong>Design: A decent plastic case, but not exactly a premium look</strong></h2><p> Aesthetics may be the Acer Aspire E 15’s weakest area — it’s a big, chunky<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-for-college-students-to-buy-4071769" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that measures in at over an inch thick at the rear and tapers to a bit less than an inch at the front. It also tips the scales at over five pounds, which is definitely on the heavy side for a 15.6” laptop.</p><p> The body, lid, and bezel are all plastic, which feels a bit cheap to the touch. But it does have a pleasant brushed pattern that breaks the monotony of the basic black case, and the interior deck features a textured metallic finish that looks and feels significantly better than the rest of the laptop.</p><p> On the right side of the Aspire E 15, you’ll find the power jack, headphone jack, a USB 2.0 port, and a DVD burner. The SD card reader is located on the front of the device, alongside the LED indicator lights. On the left side is the VGA port that Acer still loves to throw on everything, an HDMI port, two USB 3.0 ports, an ethernet jack, and a USB port.</p><p>Aesthetics may be the Acer Aspire E 15’s weakest area.</p><p> The keyboard is roomy and comfortable and the keys feel sharp and springy. The trackpad is massive and responsive, but it doesn’t feel as robust as the keyboard. The left and right buttons are incorporated into the main body of the trackpad, and they have far too much give—if we pressed down with more than the absolute minimum necessary force, it felt like the trackpad might collapse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove"><a href="#Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: A ton of bloatware to remove"></a><strong>Setup Process:</strong> <strong>A ton of bloatware to remove</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> preloaded, and the setup process isn’t really anything out of the ordinary for a Windows 10 laptop. Acer requests some contact information during the initial setup, which is something that most of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-oem-software-1701736" >OEMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do to help with warranties and support. We timed the process from start to finish, and it took about 10 minutes to go from plugging it in and turning it on, to hitting the desktop for the first time.</p><p> Once you finish the initial setup, most users will also want to take additional time to remove the substantial amount of bloatware that comes preinstalled. This isn’t necessary but is something that most users will probably want to do, and it does add quite a bit of time to the setup process if you opt to go that route.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M-q3UXEJ6htBtTcwPWAH9SLwJeI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-4-1cfdfcc543fa4eb5b5e5449b6ea37413.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color"><a href="#Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color" class="headerlink" title="Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color"></a><strong>Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color</strong></h2><p> While the Aspire E 15’s screen isn’t the brightest or most colorful in the world, it is a full HD display that absolutely shines compared to the low-resolution screens found on a lot of laptops in this category.</p><p> The display has decent viewing angles and great contrast, but the colors are a bit washed out. It’s fine for watching videos on YouTube and Netflix—and DVDs, of course—but it wouldn’t be our first choice for movie night. It’s definitely a display that’s best suited for work, with media and gaming as afterthoughts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880940/19272" target="_top" id="1880940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880940/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD"><a href="#Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD"></a><strong>Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 suffers a bit from a slow hard drive, and it could stand to have a bit more RAM, but it performs exceedingly well for a laptop in this category. It beats most of the competition in all important benchmarks and is a joy to use for productivity tasks, web browsing, and even light<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000-4148125" >gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 is available in two basic configurations. The unit we tested was the less expensive of the two, featuring an Intel Core i3-8130U running at 2.2 GHz, an Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU, and 6GB DDR3L RAM. The more expensive configuration comes with a Core i7 processor, a discrete<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161" >Nvidia graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , more RAM, and an SSD, so it performs even better.</p><p> We ran the PCMark 10 benchmark, and the Aspire E 15 recorded an overall score of 2,657. It did best in the essentials category, with a score of 5,097, and slightly worse in productivity and digital content creation with scores of 4,534 and 2,203 respectively. In comparison, the similarly-priced Lenovo Ideapad 320 managed an overall score of just 1,062.</p><p> The full HD screen and snappy performance make productivity tasks a breeze.</p><p> So how does that score translate into the real world? It means the Aspire E 15 opens apps without a lot of lag, is capable of multitasking without bogging down, and can juggle more than a dozen web browser windows without skipping a beat, even if you’re streaming video.</p><p> We also ran a few gaming benchmarks from 3DMark, with slightly less stellar results. The first one we tried was Fire Strike, which is designed for gaming laptops. It only managed a score of 855 in that benchmark, running at just 4 FPS during the graphics test and 17 FPS during the physics test.</p><p> That was significantly better than other laptops we tested in this category, but the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU was definitely a bottleneck.</p><p> We also ran the Cloud Gate benchmark, which is designed for low end desktops and basic laptops. That resulted in a score of 6,492 at 36 FPS, indicating that the Aspire E 15 is capable of basic gaming.</p><p> Next up, we installed Steam and fired up Capcom’s blockbuster hit Monster Hunter for a true torture test. Astoundingly, the game was almost playable. It took forever to load into Astera due to the slow HDD, but we set out on a short expedition anyway. The game ran at between 20 and 30 FPS the whole time, but found that the action really bogged down with a big monster on the screen.</p><p> The takeaway is that we absolutely wouldn’t recommend buying this laptop for the purpose of playing games, but it is capable of rising to the task if you’re willing to lower the settings and stick to older games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go"><a href="#Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go"></a><strong>Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go</strong></h2><p> The Aspire E 15 is designed with productivity in mind. While we found that it was capable of some light gaming, it’s definitely intended for students and people who need a basic<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The full HD screen and snappy performance make productivity tasks a breeze. You won’t have to wait around every time you want to load or switch between apps. The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, which is great for long typing sessions, and the fantastic battery life means that you can unplug for an entire work or school day without worrying about power.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0j4qIM8N-IXUlX66rWrHmqZTjxQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-3-8bdb945a491f4f4cbab64c65fa21d9af.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Audio-Decent-speakers-but-no-bass-response"><a href="#Audio-Decent-speakers-but-no-bass-response" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Decent speakers, but no bass response"></a><strong>Audio: Decent speakers, but no bass response</strong></h2><p> The speakers are decent enough, but the audio quality is still one of the Aspire E 15’s weaker points. They just don’t get all that loud, and when we did crank the volume all the way up, we noticed a bit of distortion in some frequency ranges. There isn’t a whole lot of bass, either, so everything sounds a little tinny—and that only gets worse at louder volumes.</p><p> Strangely enough, the audio is actually louder and clearer when the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/14-16-inch-laptops-833846" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is sitting on a flat surface. It seems like there is a lot of sound escaping from the vents as well as through the actual speaker grills, and placing it on a solid surface seems to improve the audio quality.</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-on-both-5-GHz-and-2-4-GHz-networks"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-on-both-5-GHz-and-2-4-GHz-networks" class="headerlink" title="Network: Great speeds on both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz networks"></a><strong>Network: Great speeds on both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz networks</strong></h2><p> The Aspire E 15 includes a wireless card that’s capable of connecting to both 2.4 and 5 GHz wireless networks, which is a nice touch if you have a wireless router that lets you take advantage of this feature. 2.4 and 5 GHz network compatibility is standard on more expensive laptops, but a lot of competitors in the budget category leave it out.</p><p> Acer advertises a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be a pretty accurate claim.</p><p> We found that the Aspire E 15 was able to achieve download speeds of 260 Mbps and upload speeds of 65 Mbps when connected to our 5 GHz network. When connected to our 2.4 GHz network, it notched speeds of 66 Mbps down and 64 Mbps up. These speeds are pretty good across the board.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-720p-webcam-takes-grainy-stills"><a href="#Camera-720p-webcam-takes-grainy-stills" class="headerlink" title="Camera: 720p webcam takes grainy stills"></a><strong>Camera: 720p webcam takes grainy stills</strong></h2><p> The included webcam is capable of capturing 720p video, and while it works well enough for basic video calls on Skype or Discord, it may not be up to the standards necessary for professional video conferencing.

Acer advertises a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be a pretty accurate claim.</p><p> Under ideal conditions (and with extremely light use) we found that the battery lasted about 14 hours in our testing. You’re unlikely to achieve this in everyday scenarios, but that’s the baseline maximum you could expect it to last.</p><p> Subjected to normal levels of use—constantly on with the brightness lowered and power management set to favor battery life—we found that the battery lasts about eight and a half hours. With similar settings, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a full day of work or school out of this laptop.</p><p> In a category where a lot of competing devices die out after four or five hours, that’s pretty remarkable.</p><h2 id="Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware"><a href="#Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware" class="headerlink" title="Software: Bogged down by bloatware"></a><strong>Software: Bogged down by bloatware</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with Windows 10, some basic Windows apps, and a free trial of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-office-365-4589808" >Microsoft 365 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It also comes with a whole bunch of bloatware from Acer, Netflix, Evernote, an outdated version of Firefox, and several games you probably won’t want or need.</p><p> If you’re a Firefox user, it might be nice to have that already downloaded (just remember to update it immediately).

It has a full HD screen, where competitors like the HP Notebook 15 and Lenovo Ideapad 320, priced at $288 and $299 respectively, both have 1366 x 768 displays. The Aspire E 15 also has more RAM than either of those laptops, a better CPU, and faster Wi-Fi speeds.</p><p> The Aspire E 15 also beats the competition, hands down, in battery life. While the Aspire E 15 can last for 12 hours, the HP Notebook 15 and Ideapad 320 both putter out at around the five-hour mark.</p><p> One thing the Aspire E 15 doesn’t have is a touchscreen, which can be found in some budget laptops.

That’s a recipe for miscommunication, and I’ve been seeing a lot of that as the industry becomes larger and more popular. In particular, some people use these ten terms in odd and often incorrect ways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111982/7443" target="_top" id="2111982">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111982" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111982/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Walking-Simulator"><a href="#Walking-Simulator" class="headerlink" title="Walking Simulator"></a>Walking Simulator</h2><p> The term “walking simulator” is a derogatory term gamers came up with for titles like <em>What Remains of Edith Finch, Gone Home,</em> and <em>Firewatch.</em> Since these titles are not actually games, but linear interactive stories, people who are interested in actual gameplay were understandably not impressed. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with an interactive story, and not everything you experience with a controller in your hands has to be a true game, but nonetheless, the term “walking simulator” applies to these non-game, interactive digital experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/death_stranding.jpeg"                      alt="Death Stranding&#39;s Capital Knot City."                > </p><p><em>Death Stranding</em><br>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Now, however, gamers often use the term “walking simulator” for titles that are true games. For example, <em>Death Stranding</em> is as much a game as <em>Skyrim</em> but because the main game mechanic is traversal and overcoming obstacles and enemies on your route, it’s erroneously dubbed a walking sim. If you’re interested in true walking simulators, our friends over at GameRant have a great list of the <a class="link"   href="https://gamerant.com/best-walking-simulators/" >best walking simulators that everyone should play <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="Simulation"><a href="#Simulation" class="headerlink" title="Simulation"></a>Simulation</h2><p> This is a tricky one, because simulation is something that happens on a spectrum. At the most extreme end, you get pure simulators such as <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> which tries to be a serious and true digital reproduction of what flying a plane is really like. Generally, pure simulations like these allow you to learn the real world skills you’d need to actually do the thing in real life.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/flight_sim.jpeg"                      alt="Flying over Westminster in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</em><br>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> However, people in the gaming world throw this word around a little liberally. There’s the tongue-in-cheek stuff like <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> where the joke is that it’s the opposite of a simulator, but then there’s a fuzzy area where some games that have a veneer of realism are referred to as simulators as well. Add to this, that simulation fidelity can vary and games often have very simplified simulations of some things in service of gameplay, and not realism, and it’s easy to apply the term where it doesn’t belong.</p><h2 id="Isometric"><a href="#Isometric" class="headerlink" title="Isometric"></a>Isometric</h2><p> “Isometric” games use a special 2D projection angle to create the impression of 3D spaces. Many classical CRPGs and tactical strategy games used this perspective before the advent of true 3D graphics. In one way or another, this term has become attached to those genres, even to games with non-isometric viewpoints, such as top-down titles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fallout_2.jpg"                      alt="Fallout 2 from Black Isle."                > </p><p>Interplay&#x2F;Bethesda Softworks</p><p> The silliest use I’ve seen myself is in reference to _Baldur’s Gate 3,_which is a true 3D game, with a movable camera that can be moved from a top-down perspective all the way down to an over-the-shoulder view. So it’s not isometric in any sense of the word. To be even more pedantic, many “isometric” games from the classic gaming era weren’t isometric either. The first <em>Fallout</em> game, for example, was trimetric.</p><h2 id="RPG"><a href="#RPG" class="headerlink" title="RPG"></a>RPG</h2><p> Role-Playing Games (RPGs) are a popular genre of game you can find in both tabletop, video game, and live-action formats. Players assume the role of a character in a fictional setting, and then explore that world, making choices, and pursuing quests and goals. These games are built on a game rules framework, such as <a class="link"   href="https://dnd.wizards.com/" >Dungeons &amp; Dragons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.sjgames.com/gurps/" >GURPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/starfield.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot from Bethesda RPG Starfield on Xbox."                > </p><p><em>Starfield</em><br>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> In recent years, more and more games outside the RPG genre have adopted elements of these games into their own designs. However, just like bolting wings to your car does not make it a plane, adding XP and item stats to an action adventure game does not make it a true RPG.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141688/17094" target="_top" id="2141688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141688/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pay-To-Win"><a href="#Pay-To-Win" class="headerlink" title="Pay-To-Win"></a>Pay-To-Win</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-visual-magic-how-to-create-stunning-video-effects-like-a-pro/" >Pay-to-win <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a term used to describe a (usually) free-to-play game that you can beat more easily by simply paying more real money.

Likewise, it can’t apply to a PvE (Player Versus Enemy) game such as <em>Helldivers II</em> because all the players are on the same side and the enemies are non-player characters.</p><h2 id="Microtransaction-vs-DLC"><a href="#Microtransaction-vs-DLC" class="headerlink" title="Microtransaction vs DLC"></a>Microtransaction vs DLC</h2><p> This is a curious one I saw for the first time not too long before writing this.

This can lead to things freezing, jumping, or even reversing on screen.</p><p> Frame rate issues happen for a number of reasons, but they are related to the performance of your computer. For example, if a game scene is too complex, your game may appear to slow down and become choppy. If it’s not caused by a network issue, then your game isn’t “lagging.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Downloading-Yes-Really"><a href="#Downloading-Yes-Really" class="headerlink" title="Downloading (Yes, Really)"></a>Downloading (Yes, Really)</h2><p> I hope this isn’t too widespread, but I’ve personally witnessed people refer to installing a game from a disc as “downloading” in a discussion on whether modern consoles can install and play games without an internet connection.

It’s the closest we’ve come to truly photorealistic graphics, but plenty of people can’t tell when something is an example of ray tracing or not. There’s a misconception that any reflections in a game that look realistic means the game has ray tracing, but that’s simply not true. To muddy things even more, ray tracing can be applied selectively to global lights like the sun, to local light, to reflections, and to shadows. For example, many games with ray tracing on current-generation consoles have ray-traced shadows, but not reflections. Yet many players think the reflections are ray-traced. Here’s a tip: ray-traced reflections usually reflect objects that are not currently visible on-screen.</p><h2 id="Indie-Games"><a href="#Indie-Games" class="headerlink" title="Indie Games"></a>Indie Games</h2><p> I saved the best for last, since it’s becoming unclear what the actual meaning of “Indie” game is. Traditionally, an indie game is an independent game. This means the studio that developed the game is not owned by a publisher or parent company. There is no creative control or interference from outside the developer, such as financiers or shareholders.</p><p> In general, most of these studios don’t have a lot of money or many employees, which means the games have limited production value. Which is why you see a lot of pixel art games. The thing is, many people now think of “indie” as an aesthetic. So there was some confusion when <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-game-awards-2023-best-indie-game-dave-the-diver-controversy/"><em>Dave the Diver</em> was nominated for best Indie game</a> when it’s very much not independent. At the same time, most people feel uncomfortable with the idea that AAA titles from independent developers like Larian Studios or Valve Software are “indies.”</p><p> Which is just a roundabout way of saying that no one seems to know what an indie game actually is anymore, so we’re all probably using that word wrong!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-blueprint-for-success-three-core-writing-principles-for-compelling-fb-ad-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved A Blueprint for Success Three Core Writing Principles for Compelling FB Ad Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-perfect-the-art-of-note-taking-mematic-way/"><u>[New] Perfect the Art of Note-Taking - Mematic Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-selecting-superior-5k-displays-the-top-eight/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Selecting Superior 5K Displays The Top Eight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-harmonizing-iphone-with-the-world-of-podcasts/"><u>[Updated] Harmonizing iPhone with the World of Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-master-youtube-monetization-tips-to-boost-income-via-shorts/"><u>[Updated] Master YouTube Monetization Tips to Boost Income via Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-silent-story-consumers-leading-anonymity-apps-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Silent Story Consumers Leading Anonymity Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-iphone-13-data-from-ios-itunes-backup-drfone-by-drfone-ios-data-recovery-ios-data-recovery/"><u>How to Recover iPhone 13 Data From iOS iTunes Backup? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-screen-use-creating-picture-in-picture-videos-on-macos/"><u>In 2024, Innovative Screen Use Creating Picture in Picture Videos on macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-comprehensive-review-of-garmins-elite-forerunner-e-745-a-game-changer-in-fitness-tracking-technology/"><u>The Comprehensive Review of Garmin's Elite Forerunner E 745: A Game-Changer in Fitness Tracking Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-logitech-c920-pro-hd-webcam-uncovered-a-thorough-review-of-its-exceptional-video-quality-features/"><u>The Logitech C920 Pro HD Webcam Uncovered: A Thorough Review of Its Exceptional Video Quality Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-must-know-insights-before-investing-in-an-unlocked-phone-model/"><u>The Must-Know Insights Before Investing in an Unlocked Phone Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-netgear-nighthawk-ax8-extender-unveiled-revolutionizing-router-coverage-for-wi-fi-6-networks/"><u>The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Extender Unveiled: Revolutionizing Router Coverage for Wi-Fi 6 Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-samsung-galaxy-a71-5g-reviewed-why-its-a-wise-alternative-to-expensive-flagship-models/"><u>The Samsung Galaxy A71 5G Reviewed - Why It's a Wise Alternative to Expensive Flagship Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-blueear-wireless-bluetooth-beanie-stylish-headwear-meets-great-sound-quality/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to the Blueear Wireless Bluetooth Beanie: Stylish Headwear Meets Great Sound Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-10-entertaining-games-to-beat-boredom-anywhere-anytime/"><u>Top 10 Entertaining Games to Beat Boredom Anywhere, Anytime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-long-distance-wireless-routers-reviews-and-comparisons/"><u>Top Long-Distance Wireless Routers - Reviews and Comparisons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/unlock-your-access-steps-to-score-free-study-streaming-with-tidal/"><u>Unlock Your Access: Steps to Score Free Study Streaming with Tidal</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This big brick of a battery pack comes in at 7.2 x 1.6 x 3.8 inches (HWD) with a weight of more than 1.5 pounds. Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.</p><p> It’s made of mostly thick black plastic outside, including a glossy brushed silver top layer with an imprinted Halo logo. The front face is where most of the ports sit, including two USB-A ports (5V&#x2F;2.4A), a DC input for the charging adapter, and jump-start inputs hidden behind a small door.

Meanwhile, the left side of the device has a bright built-in LED flashlight with a power button, giving you another handy tool during car emergencies.</p><p> The Halo Bolt also comes with an array of accessories, including a wall charging adapter, a car charging adapter, jumper cables, a USB-to-micro USB cable, and a cinching pouch for quick storage of all the above.

The battery is fully charged when all four are illuminated when pressing any of the power buttons. Otherwise, for the AC and USB ports, the Halo Bolt is a plug-and-play charger.</p><p> The whole process for jump-starting a car is detailed in the included instructions. The Halo Bolt has built-in safety features that ensure you have correctly aligned the jumper cables before starting the connected car, boat, lawnmower, or other vehicles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mUdXUjWxeupVqNR_y43_eFTC0ic=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-02-69b93dc934684ef5b71a40215f6162f2.jpg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting</strong></h2><p> The Halo Bolt has 58,830mWh of battery power within, and the official description suggests that it can provide up to several hours of additional usage for a MacBook Pro or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-4688969" >iPad Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In my testing, the results didn’t quite match those targets.</p><p> Plugging in a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >mid-2019 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge. It went from 0 percent to 88 percent in 1 hour and 30 minutes, at a maximum recorded charging rate of 58.29W (20.1V&#x2F;1.9A).</p><p> In a separate test, I played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at 100 percent brightness on the laptop, with the Halo Bolt plugged in to sustain the laptop’s fully-charged battery. The Halo Bolt provided power to the computer for 5 hours, 14 minutes before running out of battery, but that’s a fair bit less than the Mophie Powerstation AC (6 hours, 22 minutes) and ZMI PowerPort 20000 (8 hours, 4 minutes) in the same test.</p><p> Plugging in a mid-2019 MacBook Pro (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge.</p><p> Not having a USB-C Power Delivery port on the Halo Bolt is disappointing, as many modern devices rely on the standard for speedy charging. You’ll need to bring your own AC adapters to plug into the AC port to get maximum speeds.</p><p> For example, charging a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone using one of the Halo Bolt’s USB-A ports took 2 hours and 56 minutes to complete at a paltry 5.19W (4.76V x 1.09A), starting from 0 percent. However, when I repeated the test using Samsung’s charger via the AC port, it finished in 1 hour and 34 minutes thanks to fast charging—nearly half the total time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MNFqifirQ0sn61GPO1e-bLQ1t8s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-06-8bc3449bd35243aaaf67272c1d3774a6-bc803e0a114b4116adf3078af6a2de00.jpeg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-priced-right"><a href="#Price-It’s-priced-right" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s priced right"></a><strong>Price: It’s priced right</strong></h2><p> For a jack-of-all-trades power brick that can jump-start your car and charge its battery, serve as a bright flashlight for roadside emergencies, and charge a wide array of portable devices, the $100 price seen on Amazon looks pretty reasonable. However, given that it couldn’t charge my laptop to total capacity and lacks a USB-C port, handier, higher-capacity charging bricks are available specifically for laptop and smartphone charging needs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000"><a href="#Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000" class="headerlink" title="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000"></a><strong>Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000</strong></h2><p> Here’s a prime example.

However, it’s pocket-friendly, packs a lot of capacity (20,000mAh), and can quickly recharge laptops with its included USB-C port. It also has two USB-A ports and sufficient juice to recharge the same MacBook Pro from empty. Best of all, it only costs $70.</p><p> But that smaller, cheaper power brick is only meant for portable devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and handheld game systems. It has no jump-start capabilities nor an AC port to accommodate a wider array of devices.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Final Verdict: A convenient backup battery and jump starter.</strong></p><p> The Halo Bolt isn’t the best option for charging laptops, but it is a solid all-around device for providing backup power to a broader array of gadgets, not to mention jump-starting a car. This versatile device is smart to have around if you drive a car and are frequently mobile with your portable gadgets. I wouldn’t bring it with me on vacation, but it could prove useful before long as a backup device to keep handy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Bolt ACDC 58830 mWh Portable Charger&#x2F;Jump Starter</li><li>Product Brand  Halo</li><li>SKU  811279030120</li><li>Price  $100.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.2 x 3.8 x 1.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  90 Days</li><li>Ports  2x USB-A. 1x AC, 1x Jump Start</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-seamless-sharing-twitch-links-on-your-fb-page/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Seamless Sharing Twitch Links on Your FB Page</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-streamline-your-recording-process-across-all-tech-platforms-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Your Recording Process Across All Tech Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-microsoft-surface-go-assessment-navigating-its-unclear-role-in-the-market/"><u>Affordable Microsoft Surface Go Assessment: Navigating Its Unclear Role in the Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-xs-max-review/"><u>Apple iPhone XS Max Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/avoid-distraction-with-firm-footage-capture-for-2024/"><u>Avoid Distraction with Firm Footage Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-flawless-ergonomics-and-exactness-with-the-portable-sabrent-cable-free-computer-mouse-design/"><u>Discover Flawless Ergonomics & Exactness with the Portable Sabrent Cable-Free Computer Mouse Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/download-and-install-epson-wf-3540-driver-for-your-pc-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Download & Install Epson WF-3540 Driver for Your PC: Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-amplify-audience-connection-best-creative-reacting-techniques/"><u>In 2024, Amplify Audience Connection Best Creative Reacting Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/mastering-mornings-with-mirari-an-in-depth-look-at-our-kiddos-alarm-clock/"><u>Mastering Mornings with Mirari: An In-Depth Look at Our Kiddo's Alarm Clock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/overcome-macos-error-36-and-trash-issues/"><u>Overcome macOS Error 36 & Trash Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-overview-fusing-vintage-style-with-contemporary-technological-advances/"><u>Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 Overview: Fusing Vintage Style With Contemporary Technological Advances</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/smart-strategies-for-securely-saving-movie-moments-across-gadgets/"><u>Smart Strategies for Securely Saving Movie Moments Across Gadgets</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

to Look For in a Boom Mic in 2024</h2><p> The term “boom mic” can mean different things, so first, let’s clarify what exactly we’re talking about. While the term originated in the film industry for mics used to pick up audio on a set, these days, people also use the term to mean a desk-mounted type.</p><p> The first thing to consider for a desk-mounted boom mic is whether to opt for a <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guidebook-to-making-wealth-on-instagram/" >USB or XLR microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

On the other hand, you have much more to choose from if you opt for an <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/from-pages-to-production-creating-a-movie-blueprint/" >XLR microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, though you’ll need an interface to get the audio into your computer.</p><p> Second, you’ll want to consider the pickup pattern. Whether you’re talking about film-style or desk-mounted boom mics, the most popular pickup pattern is cardioid, which focuses on audio directly in front of the microphone capsule. Some desk-mounted boom mics might even use a <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-oppo-reno-11-5g-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/" >supercardioid pickup pattern <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is even more directional.</p><p> There are some extra considerations if you want to use your boom microphone for streaming. While the aesthetics of a microphone mean nothing when it comes to audio quality, this may be something to consider when the microphone is always going to be on-screen.</p><p> You’ll also want to consider the boom arm you use for a desk-mounted microphone. While many broadcast-style microphones meant for streaming include a boom arm, not all do, and the included models aren’t always the highest quality. You can always buy a separate boom arm; we even have a pick for one of our favorites.</p><p> This article mainly focuses on desk-mounted boom mics for streaming, podcasting, and videoconferencing. That said, if you’re a budding filmmaker, we also have a pick for film use. Just make sure to keep in mind that these mics are typically meant for more professional environments and may have requirements like <a class="link"   href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/spectaculous-14-animated-text-illustration-samples/" >phantom power <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>22</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It’s also a tougher microphone to gain stage properly (Shure recommends at least 60dB of gain), so you’ll want to ensure that your interface <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/" >preamps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have plenty of power. If your interface isn’t very powerful but does support phantom power, you can use a device like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Microphones-CL-1-Cloudlifter-1-channel/dp/B004MQSV04?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Cloudlifter CL-1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for extra gain.</p><p> You’re good to go once you’ve got enough gain to record the microphone properly. If you’ve ever heard a radio announcer or podcast host, chances are good that they were speaking through an SM7B. An onboard high-pass filter keeps the low rumbling from handy noise at bay, while a midrange frequency boost switch can make certain voices pop better.</p><p> You won’t get a boom arm with the Shure SM7B. While you’ll find bundles available occasionally, there is no official boom arm for the SM7B, so you’ll have to choose your own or go with our <a class="link"   href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-pioneering-innovative-webcam-functions/" >boom arm pick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> If you’re looking for something like the SM7B but don’t want to deal with an audio interface and XLR cables, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Shure MV7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is similar but more affordable and uses a USB connection instead of XLR.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/41dyrfzy7ql-_sl160_-1.jpg"                                     > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Boom Mic Overall</p><h5 id="Shure-SM7B-1"><a href="#Shure-SM7B-1" class="headerlink" title="Shure SM7B"></a>Shure SM7B</h5><p>If you take your podcasting or streaming seriously, the Shure SM7B is a great sounding and reliable pro-level mic that you’ll likely never need to upgrade from.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >See at amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Budget-Boom-Mic-NZXT-Capsule-Mini"><a href="#Best-Budget-Boom-Mic-NZXT-Capsule-Mini" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Boom Mic: NZXT Capsule Mini"></a>Best Budget Boom Mic: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NZXT-Capsule-Mini-AP-WMMIC-W1-Built/dp/B0BYMZXV5F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >NZXT Capsule Mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/52775140974_22189a33a7_o.jpg"                      alt="NZXT Capsule Mini set up on a desk"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052060/7443" target="_top" id="2052060">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052060" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052060/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Jason Montoya &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ USB connection makes getting started easy</td><td>✗ Plastic body feels somewhat fragile</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Sturdy included desk mount</td><td>✗ Boom arm is a separate purchase</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Optional boom arm is great for the price</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ Sleek look in black or white</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Finding a mic you can place on a boom arm at a budget price is easy, but finding an affordable mic and boom arm combo is much more difficult.

It also simplifies recording or streaming since you only need to plug it in and go. The microphone supports recordings up to 24-bit&#x2F;48kHz, perfect for podcasting or streaming.</p><p> The NZXT Capsule Mini is, as the name implies, on the small side. This means it’s portable and stays out of the way, even when you include the stand that comes along with the mic. This is especially useful if you’re on a budget since you can buy the microphone to make sure you like it and use the stand as a stopgap, upgrading to the boom arm later if you like the microphone.</p><p> While it isn’t part of the package, the <a class="link"   href="https://nzxt.com/product/boom-arm-mini" >NZXT Boom Arm Mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is intended as a companion to the Capsule Mini. Funnily enough, the boom arm is built more sturdy than the microphone itself, so if you opt for the boom arm, you may have it around long after you’ve upgraded to a better mic, as it can sometimes feel flimsy (as we learned in our <a class="link"   href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/empower-windows-to-keep-files-organized-quickly/" >NZXT Capture Mini review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>):</p><p> As impressive as the design of the Capsule Mini is, it feels somewhat disconcertingly light. I don’t expect a cast metal body on a microphone that retails for well under $100, but at the same time, the plastic here feels on the flimsy side. If you’re only setting up the microphone once and leaving it, this won’t be an issue.</p><p> Strangely enough, the Capsule Mini and Boom Arm Mini are hard to find packaged together. Still, they’re affordable enough to buy both for less than many comparable packages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/31-229iyr6l-_sl160_-1.jpg"                                     > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Budget Boom Mic</p><h5 id="NZXT-Capsule-Mini-1"><a href="#NZXT-Capsule-Mini-1" class="headerlink" title="NZXT Capsule Mini"></a>NZXT Capsule Mini</h5><p>The NZXT Capsule Mini is an affordable mic with a sleek look and solid sound quality.

While it’s a great microphone, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-NTG2-Multi-Powered-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00093ESSI?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Rode NTG-2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is considered ‘budget’ mainly because much of its competition costs thousands. The NTG-2 might be a budget option compared to high-end industry standards, but it’s still got plenty to offer indie filmmakers.</p><p> Despite the comparatively low price, this mic means business, so you won’t find any USB connectivity here. This is an XLR microphone, so you’ll need an audio interface, a separate audio recorder, or a camera capable of working with XLR microphones, either directly or via an adapter. The NTG-2 also requires power, but it can use phantom or battery power.</p><p> One complication of the battery power option is that there isn’t an on&#x2F;off switch for the microphone. This means that if you want to preserve the life of the AA battery, you’ll need to remove it when you’re not using the microphone. This is mainly just an inconvenience, but still one worth mentioning.</p><p> The microphone is relatively barebones, delivering solid audio without much required in the way of setup. There is a single switch on the microphone that rolls off low frequencies. If you’re filming in a busier area, this is a great way to reduce the background noise of trucks and other noisy vehicles. It also helps to prevent rumbles from wind noise.</p><p> In the standard package, you get the Rode NTG-2, a windscreen, and a standard mount.

That said, if you’re just getting into streaming, starting with something you won’t need to upgrade for a while is worthwhile. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTPZF6P1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Sennheiser Profile USB Microphone Streaming Set <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> includes a fantastic mic and a workhorse boom arm, meaning you’ll be set for quite a long time.</p><p> This is a USB microphone, which means it’s simple to use. Sennheiser continues in this direction by placing every control you’ll need frequent hands-on access to directly on the front of the mic. There’s no need to worry about diving into an app to get your settings right when everything is available right in front of you.</p><p> The boom arm that comes with the Profile Streaming Set is surprisingly high quality. It features a cable management channel on one side, helping keep the USB cable out of your way. While the boom arm doesn’t feature adjustments to tighten sections of the boom arm, this is because the arm does an impressive job of holding steady until you manually adjust it.</p><p> The Sennheiser Profile features a frequency range of 20Hz to 20kHz and supports 24-bit&#x2F;48kHz audio. This seems fairly standard, and it is, but this doesn’t speak to just how good the audio is on the Profile. It uses subtle built-in DSP to make your voice sound its best, but never flat or overly processed.</p><p> The Sennheiser Profile mic is available <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTPZF6P1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >bundled with the boom arm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but if you already have a boom arm you love, you can also buy a <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTPYCD86?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228064&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/898417/best-boom-mics/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >standalone version of the microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The arm features up to three feet of horizontal reach, meaning you can mount it near the back of your desk without worrying that it will reach a comfortable speaking position.</p><p> While many boom arms are meant to work with certain mics, this isn’t the case with the PSA1. If your microphone is within the weight limits and has a standard mounting option, it should work with the PSA1. This stand supports microphones weighing up to 2.4 lbs, shock mount included.</p><p> This is just a boom arm, so it doesn’t come with a microphone.

While DVDs and Blu-ray media are a non-issue, what about older formats like LaserDisc and VHS? Should anyone be collecting these? If so, which one makes the most sense?</p><h2 id="Quality-and-Format-Differences"><a href="#Quality-and-Format-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Quality and Format Differences"></a>Quality and Format Differences</h2><p> LaserDisc is a higher quality format than VHS, period. LaserDisc offered almost twice as many horizontal lines of detail than VHS, so there really is no comparison. However, with LaserDisc you’ll have to flip the disc over partway through most films. Like me, you probably have rose-tinted memories of what VHS looked like, but if you head to YouTube and look at digitized VHS recordings, you’ll soon realize we could barely see what was going on. While LDs are still short of DVDs in quality, on the right equipment it can still look great.</p><h2 id="Longevity-and-Durability"><a href="#Longevity-and-Durability" class="headerlink" title="Longevity and Durability"></a>Longevity and Durability</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vhs-tape-stuck-in-player-with-tape-visible.jpg"                      alt="Retro disassembled video cassette recorders with broken VHS cassette with unwound tape isolated on white background."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/retro-disassembled-video-cassette-recorders-broken-2300677303" >PhotoVrStudio &#x2F; Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> VHS tapes are not great from a longevity and durability perspective. Every time you play back a VHS tape, it gets a little more worn out. Not to mention that the tape itself will degrade over time, and it’s susceptible to magnets.</p><p> LaserDiscs, on the other hand, may also be analog in nature, but because the disc is read using a laser, there’s no wear and tear, and the quality should not degrade through normal use. However, these discs are susceptible to their own form of “<a class="link"   href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-honor-x8b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >disc rot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.” It’s not entirely clear why some LDs get disc rot, but it’s enough of a problem that enthusiasts maintain a <a class="link"   href="https://www.lddb.com/laserrot.php" >list of problematic titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Overall, I’d give this one to LaserDiscs on balance, especially since VHS seems to have its own <a class="link"   href="https://www.scanmyphotos.com/blog/2019/07/how-to-digitize-vhs-tapes.html" >inevitable decline <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well.</p><p> One thing I do worry about is the longevity of the actual players, since LDs will eventually break down when the lasers don’t work anymore, and VHS players are mechanically complex and were unreliable even when new. Well, at least the mainstream models my family could afford were. Whether there will be any way to play these media decades from now is debatable.</p><h2 id="Rarity-and-Availability"><a href="#Rarity-and-Availability" class="headerlink" title="Rarity and Availability"></a>Rarity and Availability</h2><p> LaserDisc was a relatively rare format at the best of times. One of the main reasons VHS became so popular was affordability, and the sheer number of VHS titles released. So finding VHS from the late 90s and onward should still be relatively easy. That said, you’ll find plenty of LaserDisc listings on sites like Ebay. Not as many as VHS titles based on my casual browsing, but they’re still available.</p><h2 id="Packaging-and-Artwork"><a href="#Packaging-and-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="Packaging and Artwork"></a>Packaging and Artwork</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-nightmare-before-christmas-laserdisc.jpg"                      alt="A NIghtmare Before Christmas Laserdisc"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044586/7443" target="_top" id="2044586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044586/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/ankara-turkey-january-19-2023-old-2251853805" >Erman Gunes &#x2F; Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The truth about vinyl records is that the perceived “quality” advantage it has over digital music <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzRvSWPZQYk" >doesn’t have a basis in reality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but I feel many people collect them because the shape and size of vinyl records lends itself to amazing packaging and artwork. Similarly, there’s just no comparison to how beautiful LDs can be as objects, even if you never play them. From this perspective, they are highly collectible.</p><p> VHS tapes, on the other hand, are ugly and spartan. Of course, that’s just my opinion, but in this category I just find no merit to them at all.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cost"><a href="#Cost" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h2><p> Oddly enough, as I was looking for prices on both VHS players and LD players, it seems that things more or less even out. As for the prices of the media, LDs seem quite a bit more expensive. However, I’d hazard to say that if the LD is in good condition it’s probably worth the additional asking price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cultural-and-Historical-Significance"><a href="#Cultural-and-Historical-Significance" class="headerlink" title="Cultural and Historical Significance"></a>Cultural and Historical Significance</h2><p> Let’s be honest, if any film or show that exists on either LaserDisc or VHS is available on DVD or Blu-ray, you’re far better off getting those more modern formats. If something only exists on LD or VHS, then LD seems like the better choice, and then VHS should be a last resort.</p><p> However, there is the nostalgia factor with VHS, and in the case of LDs, there might be historical value to some of them. After all, for a long time the widescreen LaserDisc releases of the original Star Wars trilogy was the only untouched version of the original theatrical edits of those movies, untouched by George Lucas’ “improvements.”</p><p> There’s no winner here, other than LD being the better option for preservation if no newer media of that content exists.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Community-and-Fandom"><a href="#Community-and-Fandom" class="headerlink" title="Community and Fandom"></a>Community and Fandom</h2><p> You’d think that LaserDisc would have a more intense fandom, but as a crude metric, consider that <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VHS/" >r&#x2F;VHS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has over 60K members, while <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LaserDisc/" >r&#x2F;LaserDisc <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a hair under 10K members. There are, of course, forums and groups dedicated to both media all over the web, but the size of the VHS community did surprise me a little.</p><p> I think perhaps a part of it has to do with just how many VHS titles there are, and there’s an endless flood of rare or obscure finds in the VHS world, whereas LDs are more about quality over quantity. A media nerd can get lost in either rabbit hole, so it’s not like I want to say one is better than the other, but the two types of collector communities sure feel like they have different “flavors” for lack of a better word.</p><hr><p> Personally, I think I’ll stick to <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/instantaneous-infiltration-of-lost-reddit-threads/" >collecting DVDs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Blu-rays, though I am a little envious of my friends who do collect LDs, until I come to my senses. Even <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/condense-cinematography-to-instagrams-max-on-macos-for-2024/" >collecting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> DVDs is starting to feel like <a class="link"   href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-high-quality-hd-videos-at-a-tap-top-10-android-choices/" >media archeology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so while going further back than that feels daunting. Whichever you might choose to collect, any preservation is worth it, and as long as you enjoy your hobby there’s probably no objectively correct answer as to which is the “right” medium to invest in.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-online-platforms-for-youtube-promotion-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ideal Online Platforms for YouTube Promotion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-ultimate-hdr-camera-lineup/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Ultimate HDR Camera Lineup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-smallfile-recorder-review-and-alternatives/"><u>2024 Approved SmallFile Recorder Review and Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-tecno-phantom-v-fold-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, A Complete Guide To OEM Unlocking on Tecno Phantom V Fold</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-is-disabled-here-is-the-way-to-unlock-disabled-apple-iphone-8-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, iPhone Is Disabled?

Star Wars: Squadrons grants you the second of these fantasies to a never before seen degree. This long-overdue follow up to the 1993 classic Star Wars: X-Wing aims to offer the same intense dogfighting, but with the advantages of modern tech. I reviewed the PC version.</p><h2 id="Setup-Some-tinkering-required"><a href="#Setup-Some-tinkering-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Some tinkering required"></a><strong>Setup: Some tinkering required</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons has a fairly hefty download before it’s playable, so be sure your hard drive has at least 26.4 GB of storage space. When the game boots up you can alter basic settings to set language, volume, display settings, and everything else needed to optimize your experience. I struggled a bit to get it to play well with my dual-screen setup, but eventually, I was able to get it to a playable state on my ultra-widescreen Samsung CHG90 display. In the end, I found it more comfortable to play on a standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1xt9t7ffMjuv6ggtXGJER_irSnk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-2-fcfb7e9a60e74ce9b42cecff0e2061ed.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps"><a href="#Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps" class="headerlink" title="Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps"></a><strong>Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps</strong></h2><p> The game picks up after the destruction of Alderaan in A New Hope. You get to play both sides of the conflict in alternating story missions as both an Imperial pilot and a Rebel pilot. Both characters are customizable with a range of preset options. I always appreciate it when a game gives me the option to create my own character.</p><p> The range of presets is fairly limited, but welcome nonetheless. As is traditional for me, I chose to rename the protagonists after characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. The Rebel hero became Lu-Tze, with the evil Vorbis on the side of the Empire. I was happy to be able to find a suitably sinister British accent for Vorbis, though hilarious results are possible with mismatched voices and characters. In the end, though, you’ll be spending most of the game from a first-person perspective, with your character only briefly present in cutscenes.</p><p>Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p> Next, you can choose whether you’d like a more guided experience with the standard HUD, or if you’d prefer a more immersive and challenging experience. The game also offers a mode where only your cockpit instruments are displayed. It’s probably a good idea to start off in the standard mode until you get to grips with the controls and gameplay. Lastly, choose your difficulty setting (which will depend on your general experience with flight games), and you’re off to battle.</p><p> Squadrons starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission to teach you how to fly. Though it’s somewhat prolonged, the initial awe of the scenery of an Imperial battlegroup banishes any boredom that you might expect from a tutorial mission. Gliding around Star Destroyers and other classic Star Wars spaceships is quite an experience.</p><p> The story is passable, if not terribly deep or ambitious, and is basically there to connect the battle sequences and give context to the fight. Voice acting varies from mediocre to passable, and there’s clearly some effort put into establishing likeable characters. However, though the character models are good, there’s definitely a bit of the uncanny valley on display here, and it’s particularly noticeable in the first-person conversations where you stare dumbly on as an NPC spouts exposition at you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_MN0adYtaTCJ1Qhmsivk-M-DkXo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-3-31074635684244d48b1d792540a477e2.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> In between story missions you are fixed in place in different rooms, where you click on different characters to talk to them. I found these sequences to be very linear and I found that they tended to drag on. I’d certainly have preferred to be able to walk around rather than teleport between locations on the ship. This is probably due to this game being intended to be played in VR where the fixed positioning makes more sense due to the limitations of VR, but the game would’ve been well served by separate control schemes. This is a minor gripe; if desired you can just skip through these sequences pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep"><a href="#Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep"></a><strong>Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep</strong></h2><p> The real meat of the game is in battle, and it’s an incredibly intense and immersive experience. Whatever system or control method you’re utilizing, there are a lot of different inputs and functions to learn. This would be daunting to newcomers, but the campaign does a great job of gradually introducing new controls and mechanics at a pace that makes them easy to pick up.</p><p> One of the most complex aspects of the game is team and system management, which involves making quick decisions about the layout of your ship and the behaviour of your allies. The basic power systems are easy to master, and simple “attack this” and “defend that” commands aren’t hard to learn, but there are more complicated systems as well that add a level of depth to the game for dedicated players.</p><p> Both the empire and rebels have a range of four classes of ships to choose from - a jack-of-all-trades fighter, a slow bomber with a fearsome arsenal of weapons, a fast and agile interceptor, and a support class ship. I really appreciated that the game doesn’t just make these reskinned mechanically identical clones for each faction. Instead, each side has its unique quirks that affect gameplay, and somehow the designers were still able to balance the game so that neither team feels outgunned by the other.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive. There is some of the traditional looping around in circles, but between the obstacles placed about the map, the different capabilities of the various ships, and the interaction between you and your teammates, this happens only occasionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/COT6eEVvzd6QqCbhmtbP4a_C--Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-6-9d086810906a486b9266ec247e2ab966-3636fb8670644ae98afd0bc57b59df8d.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The one thing that pulled me out of the game at times was the somewhat wonky ship physics, which make sense from the pilot’s seat, but look a bit weird to see from other ships. You can stop quickly and turn on a dime, which benefits gameplay on a technical level, but is a bit jarring and unrealistic to witness.</p><p> One important aspect of gameplay is how Squadrons balances the fragility of its fighters with creating a fun experience. It does this using shields and repair kits that vary from ship to ship and which can be customized. It walks the fine line between allowing you to mow down enemy fighters without wailing away at them for ages, while also preventing you from feeling like you’re piloting a glass canon.</p><p> There’s also ship customization, which allows you to alter various aspects of your aircraft such as armament, hull, and engines to enhance various attributes, though this usually comes at a cost to other capabilities. For example, you can trade speed for extra agility and vice versa. It requires a deep understanding of the ship you’re customizing so you’ll probably want to wait to touch this till you’ve had plenty of practice in battle. There are also cosmetic customizations, such as paint jobs and ornaments. Both gameplay and cosmetic customizations are purchased with separate types of in-game currency.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136624/26400" target="_top" id="2136624">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136624" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136624/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous. Ships are lovingly rendered and great detail was paid to getting the lighting, environments, and effects just right. The cockpits of the different ships you pilot are fully realized and mesmerizing in their realism. It’s easy to get sucked into ogling a grand alien vista or just reveling in the experience of being in the cockpit of an honest to goodness X-Wing. Explosions, lasers, enemy ships tearing apart in fiery gouts of flame, and the realistic damage to your own ship, provoke many tense situations that hit home and are bound to get your heart racing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a-_aXPmbq5vlMG21Sutf0cIe4BI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-7-dc3679df974e4da793c52f2fb2831eac.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The game is less attractive in VR, with muddier textures and blurrier skybox, but the trade-off for added immersion is well worth the sacrifice. Actually moving your head to scan around the glass cockpit for enemy fighters and capital ships (or your own wingmates) and then diving in to engage is some of the most fun you can have in VR.</p><h2 id="Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars"><a href="#Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Authentic Star Wars"></a><strong>Audio: Authentic Star Wars</strong></h2><p> With the vast majority of video games, your experience is almost as dependent on what you hear as what you see. In this regard, Squadrons is a masterpiece. This game perfectly replicates the epic feel of classic Star Wars space combat from the laser fire, to the roar of your engines, to the exhilarating whoosh of grazing an asteroid. There’s also the unforgettable John Williams soundtrack, which is fully present here and is just as vital to the experience of the game as it is to the films.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs"><a href="#Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs"></a><strong>Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs</strong></h2><p> I was able to get consistently high frame rates during gameplay with my custom gaming PC running 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor, and an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU. However, I experienced some odd stuttering in the hanger between missions, which seemed more of a graphical bug than an issue with the power of my PC. I also played Squadrons on a laptop with a less powerful processor, 16GB of RAM, and a Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q. The game performed well and provided a smooth gameplay experience at maximum graphical settings.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive.</p><h2 id="Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs"><a href="#Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Wide support for different inputs"></a><strong>Controls: Wide support for different inputs</strong></h2><p> Squadrons offers customizable support for a wide range of different control schemes, from gamepads to HOTAS flight sticks to mouse and keyboard. I had to fiddle with a few settings to get my stick and thrust control up and running, but when I did, it added an extra layer of immersion to the experience. However, mouse and keyboard is clearly the optimal and intended control method for Squadrons.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139112/17108" target="_top" id="2139112">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139112" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139112/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights"><a href="#Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights"></a><strong>Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights</strong></h2><p> Squadrons features a basic but robust multiplayer mode, the bread and butter of which are team-based dogfights.

It’s not the longest game, and there is a limit to end-game multiplayer content, so $40 is pretty much the exact right price for Squadrons. It’s refreshing to see a distinct lack of any extra monetization in the game, with no annoying microtransactions or loot boxes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983472">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983472%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983472/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous"><a href="#Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous"></a><strong>Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a deeper, more daunting, complex space sim, Elite Dangerous is the next step. Squadrons is far more exciting, being laser-focused on intense aerial combat. Elite Dangerous is a more methodical game, with a focus on exploration and trading, though there’s also exciting combat there if you want it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> An exhilarating space combat experience that is particularly well suited to VR.</p><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is a fine successor to classic space combat games, and is an undeniably exciting and realistic experience. It’s best if played with a VR headset, but is worth your time and money on a traditional screen as well. The memory of my first flight at the helm of a TIE Fighter in this game has stuck with me with surprising clarity in a way that few moments in video games do, and it’s something you really have to experience for yourself to understand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137973/21526" target="_top" id="2137973">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137973" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137973/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Star Wars: Squadrons</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Rating  Teen</li><li>Platform  PC, PS4, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-digital-storytelling-unlocked-creating-memorable-slideshows-on-fb/"><u>[Updated] Digital Storytelling Unlocked Creating Memorable Slideshows on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-from-passive-to-profitable-youtube-revenue-techniques/"><u>[Updated] From Passive to Profitable YouTube Revenue Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-sluggish-to-speedy-select-android-tools/"><u>2024 Approved From Sluggish to Speedy Select Android Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-news.techidaily.com/abbyy-and-blue-prism-unite-to-deliver-revolutionary-automation-solutions/"><u>ABBYY and Blue Prism Unite to Deliver Revolutionary Automation Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/apple-watch-series-4-evaluation-advancements-and-superior-performance-unveiled/"><u>Apple Watch Series 4 Evaluation: Advancements and Superior Performance Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/breakthrough-in-digital-preservation-discover-stellars-revolutionary-image-restoration-application-changing-the-game-globally/"><u>Breakthrough in Digital Preservation: Discover Stellar's Revolutionary Image Restoration Application, Changing the Game Globally</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discovering-the-excellence-of-samsungs-qn5n55q6f-your-next-level-viewing-experience-in-4k-smart-tvs/"><u>Discovering the Excellence of Samsung's QN5n55q6f: Your Next-Level Viewing Experience in 4K Smart TVs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/dying-light-review-mastering-the-art-of-survival-with-friends-in-a-thrilling-zombie-world/"><u>Dying Light Review -

When Selecting a DVD Player in 2024</h2><p> Streaming is the most popular way to watch TV shows and movies nowadays, and this format is <a class="link"   href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-optimal-series-prime-webcam-support-accessories/" >likely here to stay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But there are still plenty of reasons to want a Blu-ray and DVD player. It’s possible you’ve balked at the high prices streaming providers ask, especially when looking for new content. And when you’re not <a class="link"   href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-screen-space-the-art-of-close-up-views/" >getting anything tangible <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to call your own, it’s easy to get nostalgic about old collections.</p><p> Besides, now is a <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-oppo-a78-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >great time to start a new collection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or even continue an old one. Blu-rays provide superior video and audio quality to <a class="link"   href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >streaming services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You also don’t need to rely on internet speeds or any internet at all, for that matter.</p><p> However, when buying a player for your Blu-rays and DVDs, you’ll need to consider some essential factors first. To begin with, you need to assess disc compatibility. Some Blu-ray players are region-locked. This means they are incompatible with any disc from outside the region where you bought it. Make sure your player is not region-locked if you plan on buying discs from outside your country.</p><p> You should also consider the formats that the player is compatible with. There’s little point in buying a standard Full HD (1080p) Blu-ray player if all your discs are 4K—they simply won’t play. However, by purchasing a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player, you can upscale lower-res discs, including standard Blu-rays and DVDs. You may also plan on purchasing 3D Blu-rays, but you’ll need a compatible player to play these, as well as a TV that supports this format.</p><p> HDR (or high-dynamic-range) compatibility is another essential consideration. In a perfect world, all players will support Dolby Vision, <a class="link"   href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/" >HDR10+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, HDR10, and HLG. However, Blu-ray players are often selective in their support, so ensure it is compatible with your favored HDR format before purchase.</p><p> Most Blu-ray players will also play CDs, but it’s worthwhile to check if audio is part of your plans. Not all players will support high-resolution audio formats like DVD-Audio (DVD-A) and SACD (Super Audio CD). If you consider yourself an audiophile and you want the best sound from your player, it’s best to check that it supports these formats.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047406/19272" target="_top" id="2047406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Overall-Panasonic-DP-UB820-K"><a href="#Best-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Overall-Panasonic-DP-UB820-K" class="headerlink" title="Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player Overall: Panasonic DP-UB820-K"></a>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player Overall: <a class="link"   href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Panasonic DP-UB820-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub820-k.jpg"                      alt="A Panasonic DP-UB820-K under a giant, vibrant TV screen."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997722/19272" target="_top" id="1997722">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997722" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997722/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Panasonic</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Outstanding image quality</td><td>App selection is pretty limited</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent audio</td><td>Impractical remote</td></tr><tr><td>Supports all major HDR formats</td><td>Quite big</td></tr><tr><td>Good value</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Various connectivity options</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Our top overall pick for the best Blu-ray and DVD player is the <a class="link"   href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Panasonic DP-UB820-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It supports <a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/" >4K Ultra HD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Blu-rays, standard Blu-rays, 3D Blu-rays, and DVDs. It will also play any CDs from your collection.</p><p> 4K Blu-rays look especially incredible when played through the UB820. Panasonic’s Hollywood Cinema Experience (HCX) tech ensures colors stand out with natural saturation, while blacks are deep and inky against the vibrant chroma. Details are sharp and textured without being overly dramatic, and the player supports HDR formats such as Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG. It also effectively upscales to 4K, breathing new life into your lower-resolution discs.</p><p> With support for <a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >Dolby Atmos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and DTS:X, the audio complements the picture well with a good speaker setup.

These include two HDMI options with one A&#x2F;V and one audio, a digital optical output for high-quality audio to your external sound system, and two USB ports for playing media from an external hard drive or USB stick.</p><p> The player also supports analog audio output, although fussy audiophiles will likely not be too impressed with the sound quality. Another downside is the remote. Its overcrowded buttons and lack of backlighting make it difficult to use in a dimmed room. Additionally, while the build is lightweight and durable, you can still hear the discs spinning at times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub820-k.png"                      alt="Panasonic DP-UB820-K"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player Overall</p><h5 id="Panasonic-DP-UB820-K-1"><a href="#Panasonic-DP-UB820-K-1" class="headerlink" title="Panasonic DP-UB820-K"></a>Panasonic DP-UB820-K</h5><p>$420 $498 Save $78 </p><p>The Panasonic DP-UB820-K offers exceptional 4K image quality, vibrant colors, and striking contrast at a reasonable price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$420 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Panasonic-DP-UB820-K-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-ray-Player-with-HDR10-and-Dolby-Vision-Playback/352729721" >See at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=2QzUaswX1as&mid=44583&u1=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&murl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fareyouahuman%253Freferer%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.newegg.com%25252Fp%25252F12K-005E-002M2&ourl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fp%252F12K-005E-002M2" >See at Newegg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Budget-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Panasonic-DP-UB154-K"><a href="#Best-Budget-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Panasonic-DP-UB154-K" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Blu-Ray and DVD Player: Panasonic DP-UB154-K"></a>Best Budget Blu-Ray and DVD Player: <a class="link"   href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Panasonic-4K-Blu-Ray-Player-Ultra-HD-Premium-Video-Playback-and-Hi-Res-Audio-DP-UB150-K/852048134" >Panasonic DP-UB154-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub154-k.jpg"                      alt="A Panasonic DP-UB154-K"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137228/26400" target="_top" id="2137228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137228/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Panasonic</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Excellent picture quality</td><td>No Dolby Vision</td></tr><tr><td>Effective upscaling</td><td>Awkward menu system</td></tr><tr><td>Affordable</td><td>Basic remote</td></tr></tbody></table><p> If you seek something for playing 4K Blu-ray discs without all the extra fluff, the <a class="link"   href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Panasonic-4K-Blu-Ray-Player-Ultra-HD-Premium-Video-Playback-and-Hi-Res-Audio-DP-UB150-K/852048134" >Panasonic DP-UB154-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is for you.

This is particularly evident in its picture quality, which is among the best you’ll find in a Blu-ray player.</p><p> The 4K pops out with color and detail. In bright scenes, details are sharp, and the HDR optimizer does a great job of fine-tuning content for an even better picture. Colors are energetic, and gradations are silky, making this the ultimate 4K Blu-ray player despite the high price. Even the advanced 4K upscaling ensures low-res DVDs are close to UHD quality.</p><p> The DP-UB9000 supports all major <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/" >HDR formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, including Dolby Vision and HDR10+. But this Blu-ray player excels in more than just picture quality. The audio is also top-notch with the DP-UB9000. Dialog is sharp, music is detailed with subtle nuances you might not usually hear, and there is a spacious soundstage. Of course, you’ll need a good speaker setup, which the player supports via its 7.1 multichannel audio output.</p><p> Audiophiles may be disappointed to learn that the player lacks DVD-Audio and SACD support. However, less particular music fans can play their CDs just fine. On top of the 7.1 channel output, there are also a plethora of connectivity options. These include dual HDMI outputs that allow separate audio and video handling for improved quality, balanced XLR&#x2F;RCA outputs for interference-free stereo playback, and optical and coaxial outputs for pristine digital sound.</p><p> Finally, if build quality is a major consideration for you, go ahead and add this player to your cart, as it feels indestructible at times. It features a heavy steel chassis and an aluminum top panel, which keeps vibrations and noise to a minimum. This is further enhanced by the steel plate on the disc drive and effective anti-slip pads on the bottom. It’s a weighty Blu-ray player, but it can take a bit of abuse.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub9000.png"                      alt="Panasonic DP-UB9000"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best 4K Blu-Ray and DVD Player</p><h5 id="Panasonic-DP-UB9000-1"><a href="#Panasonic-DP-UB9000-1" class="headerlink" title="Panasonic DP-UB9000"></a>Panasonic DP-UB9000</h5><p>The Panasonic DP-UB9000 is a premium Blu-ray player that delivers exceptional picture and audio quality, with support for all major HDR formats and extensive connectivity options.

Sony’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00230269" >DSEE HX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technology also restores the detail and clarity of compressed audio files, making them sound closer to high-resolution content.</p><p> With dual-band Wi-Fi, the X800 supports 2.4 and 5GHz networks. This is an improvement on its more affordable predecessor, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Theater-Streaming-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B08ZFYVS9T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Sony UBP-X700M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which supported only single-band 2.4GHz. This upgrade offers a more stable Wi-Fi performance, but it is improved even further by the player’s MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) technology. This tech uses multiple transmitters and receivers to transfer more data simultaneously. You can enjoy faster and more stable streaming than usual, and you can even venture a bit further away from your router than you might typically do.</p><p> But it’s with 4K streaming that you can see this technology display its full potential when handling the required high data transfer rates. However, it’s worth noting that, like most DVD players, streaming services are limited. With the X800, you are restricted to Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube. The player’s other connectivity options include dual HDMI for separate audio and visual output, USB, digital coaxial out, Ethernet, and Bluetooth.</p><p> Regarding the design, it is very minimalist. In fact, it is so unadorned that you may not even know the player is on, given there is no display of any kind. Even the power indicator is so discreet that it’s almost imperceptible. However, it has a sturdier construction than previously, with its metal chassis making it more durable. However, this adds to the weight, making it heavier than its predecessor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sony-ubp-x800m2.png"                      alt="Sony UBP-X800M2"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player with Wi-Fi</p><h5 id="Sony-UBP-X800M2-1"><a href="#Sony-UBP-X800M2-1" class="headerlink" title="Sony UBP-X800M2"></a>Sony UBP-X800M2</h5><p>$178 $260 Save $82 </p><p>The Sony UBP-X800M2 offers excellent 4K picture quality and high-res audio performance at a reasonable price point.

It’s a 10.1-inch compact player with two screens that play standard Blu-rays, DVDs, CDs, and video files from an SD card or USB drive. Note that this is not a 4K Blu-ray player and is incompatible with anything higher than 1080p (Full HD).</p><p> Despite this, Full HD video does look very good on the displays. The audio is surprisingly good, too, with dual stereo speakers loud enough to go headphone-free. At the same time, their front-facing design helps to avoid disturbing passengers in the front.</p><p> However, sometimes, younger kids’ shows can get on the repetitive side for adults who are focusing on their driving skills. In this case, there is a headphone jack on each display that you can utilize, allowing you to take control of the noise levels in the car. However, there is no Bluetooth, so if you wish to use wireless headphones with the player, you’ll need an adapter, such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Transmitter-Headphones-Airplanes/dp/B07Z13H4TP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Twelve South AirFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> The included AV in&#x2F;out cable connects the dual screens, and you can conveniently strap each display to the front seat headrests. The battery life is around three hours, enough for at least one (long) movie, but you can also power the player with your 12V car adapter. This ensures even the longest road trip can be filled with the joys of Pixar and Disney’s finest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/naviskauto-dual-screen-blu-ray-dvd-player.png"                      alt="A NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player with remote."                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player for Travel</p><h5 id="NAVISKAUTO-Dual-Screen-Blu-Ray-DVD-Player-1"><a href="#NAVISKAUTO-Dual-Screen-Blu-Ray-DVD-Player-1" class="headerlink" title="NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player"></a>NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player</h5><p>The NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player is an excellent entertainment solution for family road trips.

Most of them are designed to play at least Blu-ray, DVD, and CD formats. But if playing music is a major factor for you, you may also wish to consider SACD, DVD-A, and other high-resolution audio formats. Check for compatibility beforehand if this is the case. </p><h3 id="Can-gaming-consoles-play-Blu-rays-If-so-which-ones"><a href="#Can-gaming-consoles-play-Blu-rays-If-so-which-ones" class="headerlink" title="Can gaming consoles play Blu-rays? If so, which ones?"></a>Can gaming consoles play Blu-rays? If so, which ones?</h3><p> You can play Blu-rays on some gaming consoles. Certain next-gen systems support 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays, such as the standard PS5 and the Xbox One X. However, it’s important to note that the PS5 (Digital Edition) and the Xbox Series S do not have disc drives and will not play any Blu-rays or other discs. </p><p> The PS3, PS4, and PS4 Pro, and the original Xbox One support standard Blu-rays only. In other words, they won’t play 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays, just regular, old Full HD (1080p) discs.</p><h3 id="Are-Blu-rays-better-than-streaming"><a href="#Are-Blu-rays-better-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Are Blu-rays better than streaming?"></a>Are Blu-rays better than streaming?</h3><p> There are pros and cons, so it depends on the individual. Blu-rays offer a superior audio and visual experience, especially when watching in 4K. They also support advanced audio formats, such as Dolby Atmos and DTS.</p><p> A lack of reliance on an internet connection or speed is also advantageous, but you don’t have to take a physical disc with you when watching your movies or shows on the go.</p><p> In fact, streaming eliminates the need for storage space anywhere other than your device or the cloud. You can watch media on any device you choose from anywhere you are. But many people prefer their physical collections and enjoy the space they consume.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-efficient-editing-for-quick-youtube-content-for-2024/"><u>[New] Efficient Editing for Quick YouTube Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-team-discussions-combining-slack-and-filmora-for-professionals/"><u>[Updated] Streamlining Team Discussions Combining Slack and Filmora for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-tech-skills-record-on-hangouts/"><u>2024 Approved Essential Tech Skills Record on Hangouts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/future-ready-sound-expert-picks-for-bestsmartspeakers/"><u>Future-Ready Sound: Expert Picks for Best#SmartSpeakers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-does-the-stardust-trade-cost-in-pokemon-go-on-xiaomi-13t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How does the stardust trade cost In pokemon go On Xiaomi 13T? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-asus-rog-phone-8-screen-not-working-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Resolve Asus ROG Phone 8 Screen Not Working | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-best-minecraft-experience-for-every-age-group/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Best Minecraft Experience for Every Age Group</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/innovative-portable-blu-ray-burning-an-insightful-review-of-the-pioneer-bdr-xs06-performance-and-mobility/"><u>Innovative Portable Blu-Ray Burning: An Insightful Review of the Pioneer BDR-XS06 Performance & Mobility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/insightful-review-discovering-the-intelligent-design-within-tcl-roku-s325-32-inch-led-tv/"><u>Insightful Review: Discovering the Intelligent Design Within TCL Roku S325 32-Inch LED TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/is-monterey-worth-installing-your-guide/"><u>Is Monterey Worth Installing?

To understand why CRTs were an essential part of the light gun’s design, it’s important to first understand how light guns functioned.</p><p> Contrary to their name, light guns don’t shoot out light (or anything else, for that matter). Instead, they contain built-in sensors (called photodiodes) that can detect lights on the screen to determine whether you hit or miss an in-game “target.”</p><p> Although there were numerous early iterations of the light gun, like the Magnavox Odyssey’s Shooting Gallery, the standard design for most light guns was <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-huawei-nova-y91-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/" >formally established with the NES Zapper <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> In games that utilize the Zapper, pulling the trigger activates a sensor that detects if you are aiming at a valid target when firing. However, since the Zapper sensor only reacts to bright light sources, the trigger pull also causes the screen to black out for a few frames, with the targets being momentarily replaced by white boxes. This allowed the Zapper to easily distinguish targets apart from the background.</p><p> After pulling the trigger, the Zapper’s light sensors quickly detect if you are aiming at a target. They also scan the surrounding background to determine which target you hit. If the white box that represents a target is detected near the center of the sensor when firing, the game registers your input as a hit. Activating the sensor while aiming anywhere outside these boxes counts as a miss.</p><p> Despite its innovative design, the Zapper relies heavily on the CRT’s analog display to function. Even the slightest amount of latency or input lag disrupts the sensitive timing between the trigger pull and flashing screen, ruining the light sensor’s hit detection. As such, the quick and consistent display of a CRT monitor was vital for early light gun shooters.</p><h2 id="Light-Guns-Evolved-with-New-Technology"><a href="#Light-Guns-Evolved-with-New-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Light Guns Evolved with New Technology"></a>Light Guns Evolved with New Technology</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00bbfa7c.jpg"                      alt="Terminator 2 arcade cabinet with light guns."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1175223/12108" target="_top" id="1175223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1175223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1175223/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Cory Gunther &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> As light gun games improved, so did their respective peripherals. Games like <em>Virtua Cop</em>, <em>T</em> <em>ime Crisis</em>, and <em>The House of the Dead</em> set a new standard for light gun shooters in the 90s. Their switch to 3D graphics and faster gameplay was made possible thanks to a new form of light gun.</p><p> Light guns of the 90s adopted a new method for light detection called “cathode-ray timing.” As its name implies, this form of light detection relies on CRTs and the unique way that they display video.</p><p> CRT televisions output images by using cathode-ray tubes that fire an electron beam across the screen. Upon reaching the opposite end of the screen, the beam continues downward, moving in horizontal rows until it has covered the entire monitor. This beam is then adjusted to display a specific image on the screen.</p><p> This entire process happens so fast and frequently that our eyes perceive the rapid movement of the electron beam as full images. However, the sensors within a light gun can track this movement and are even able to determine when the electron beam reaches a specific part of the screen.</p><p> Much like the NES Zapper, light guns that utilize cathode-ray timing contain a sensor that activates after every trigger pull. However, cathode-ray timing is far more accurate than the Zapper’s detection method, as it allows the light gun to detect the exact position you aimed at on the screen by calculating the time it takes for the CRT’s electron beam to reach that position.</p><p> Cathode-ray timing not only helped light guns become even more accurate, but also allowed 90s light gun shooters to implement new features such as on-screen crosshairs, destructible environments, and enemies that react to being hit in specific body parts.</p><h2 id="Modern-Screens-Can’t-Support-Conventional-Light-Guns"><a href="#Modern-Screens-Can’t-Support-Conventional-Light-Guns" class="headerlink" title="Modern Screens Can’t Support Conventional Light Guns"></a>Modern Screens Can’t Support Conventional Light Guns</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-living-room-with-a-tv.jpg"                      alt="A living room with a TV."                > </p><p>Lucas Gouveia &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Unfortunately, the eventual decline of CRT televisions proved disastrous for light guns. Not only were traditional light guns designed with CRTs in mind, but modern LCD (liquid-crystal display) monitors are incompatible with these peripherals for numerous reasons.</p><p> LCD televisions use a multi-layer backlight display to adjust the colors that appear on-screen. LED monitors feature a similar design, but utilize an array of LED lights to output clearer and brighter images than the average LCD monitor.</p><p> Whereas CRTs use electron beams to display images on screen, resulting in the slight screen delay that supports cathode-ray timing, both LEDs and LCDs display all pixels on screen simultaneously. As a result, traditional light guns are unable to calculate where you’re aiming when using an LCD monitor, making them essentially unusable with modern televisions.</p><p> Even earlier light gun models like the NES Zapper don’t function properly with modern televisions. CRT monitors use analog signals, which allow inputs from a controller or light gun to register on-screen without any delay. In contrast, nearly all modern televisions utilize digital signals, which have higher latency and consequentially take longer to process inputs.</p><p> Because light guns need to register both the input from a trigger pull and information from the screen within milliseconds to work properly, this delay renders most classic light gun shooters functionally unplayable.</p><h2 id="Can-Light-Gun-Shooters-Make-a-Comeback"><a href="#Can-Light-Gun-Shooters-Make-a-Comeback" class="headerlink" title="Can Light Gun Shooters Make a Comeback?"></a>Can Light Gun Shooters Make a Comeback?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sinden-lightgun-and-retro-games.jpg"                      alt="The Sinden Lightgun in three color variants and 4 light gun shooting games, including The House of the Dead, Time Crisis II, Virtua Cop 2, and Point Blank."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Sinden Lightgun</p><p> There have been numerous attempts at reviving the light gun genre through new games and peripherals. Early attempts at designing light guns for modern screens used infrared (IR) emitters, which allow for the peripheral to be tracked by an external motion sensor. The most popular examples of this technology include the GunCon 3 and the Wii Remote (as well as its light gun attachment, the Wii Zapper).</p><p> IR-based light guns helped spark a brief revival of the light gun genre in both arcades and on home consoles. Light gun shooters became especially popular on the Wii, leading to the releases of notable titles like <em>Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</em> and <em>The</em> <em>House of the Dead: Overkill</em>. Despite their popularity, IR-based peripherals didn’t match the speed or accuracy of traditional light guns, which prevented the genre from finding the same level of success as it did in the CRT era.</p><p> When the popularity of motion controls died down, light gun games and peripherals became increasingly rare. Virtual reality (VR) rail shooters prove that the light gun genre is still alive, even if it’s moving away from its physical roots. By removing the problem of designing a controller that works with modern screens, VR games like <em>Pistol Whip</em>, <em>Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope</em>, and <em>Until Dawn: Rush of Blood</em> deliver exhilarating and energetic experiences that are heavily reminiscent of classic light gun games.</p><p> Additionally, some VR emulators like EmuVR allow you to play retro light gun shooters without the issues that plague modern screens. And for those who prefer to use a physical peripheral, light gun-inspired controllers like the PlayStation VR Aim allow you to enjoy the advantages of VR while retaining the charm of holding a light gun.</p><p> Although <a class="link"   href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/reliable-software-for-swift-iphone-data-rescue-regain-what-youve-lost/" >VR is becoming the new hub for light gun-inspired shooters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that doesn’t mean it will completely replace physical light guns. The Sinden Lightgun is a modern light gun peripheral, and arguably one of the best since the 90s. It uses a built-in camera to establish a border around your monitor and then tracks where you aim within that defined border. Furthermore, the Sinden Lightgun works with nearly any PC light gun shooter (including emulated games).</p><p> But the Sinden Lightgun comes with a hefty price tag of $107.99 (or $159.99 for a variant with added recoil) and requires a lengthy set-up process. As such, it’s unlikely to appeal to anyone who isn’t already a fan of light guns. While it may not be single-handedly reviving the genre, the Sinden Lightgun proves that classic light gun shooters have a chance at making a resurgence in the future.</p><h2 id="The-Future-of-Light-Guns"><a href="#The-Future-of-Light-Guns" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Light Guns"></a>The Future of Light Guns</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/vr-headset-aiming-controllers.jpg"                      alt="A man wearing a VR headset and aiming with controllers."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/energetic-young-man-wearing-virtual-reality-1447982630" >Gorodenkoff&#x2F;Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Although the rise of modern flat-screen televisions has made light gun shooters far less accessible, the genre is still alive thanks to innovations in both physical peripherals and VR experiences.</p><p> It’s still too early to tell if either of these fields can launch light gun shooters back into mainstream popularity, but die-hard fans of the genre can finally enjoy retro classics and modern throwbacks without a CRT.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-up-your-streams-advanced-practices-for-capturing-vr-playtimes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Step Up Your Streams Advanced Practices for Capturing VR Playtimes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-iphones-guide-creating-your-first-music-video/"><u>[New] IPhone's Guide Creating Your First Music Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-capturing-timeless-moments-iphones-prolonged-shots-guide/"><u>[Updated] Capturing Timeless Moments IPhone’s Prolonged Shots Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-id-unlock-from-iphone-xs-max-how-to-fix-it-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Apple ID Unlock From iPhone XS Max?

class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in a Wi-Fi Adapter in 2024"></a>What to Look for in a Wi-Fi Adapter in 2024</h2><p> Wi-Fi adapters look like relatively simple devices, but as you start to look at available adapters, you quickly learn that there are many configurations available. Some are tiny external adapters that are easy to pack with a laptop, others require opening up your PC tower to install, while others still have multiple antennas to get the best signal possible. What should you look for to get the right Wi-Fi adapter for you?</p><p> The first thing to consider is which wireless standards a Wi-Fi adapter is designed to work with. If you have a <a class="link"   href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/illustrator-tutorial-bringing-text-to-life-for-2024/" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> router, it makes sense to get a Wi-Fi adapter that also supports Wi-Fi 6. A Wi-Fi adapter that only supports up to <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-tricks-to-make-your-profile-video-stand-out/" >Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will work, but it won’t take full advantage of the newer and faster wireless standard.</p><p> Additionally, Beamforming and MIMO (Multi-input, Multi-output) are designed to improve wireless networking performance. They usually go hand-in-hand, and compatibility with both is desirable in any modern Wi-Fi adapter.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-oppo-find-x7-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Beamforming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a way of focusing a wireless signal towards a single receiving device, making connections faster and more reliable, while MIMO allows multiple antennas to be used as both transmitter and receiver. <a class="link"   href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-apple-iphone-se-2022-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Multi-user, Multi-input, Multi-output) is the same but allows multiple devices to use MIMO simultaneously.</p><p> Just remember that both MIMO and beamforming are router-based technologies. If your router does not provide them, your Wi-Fi adapter can’t use them.</p><p> If you use a Windows desktop PC, you have the widest choice of Wi-Fi adapters. You can choose either an external USB adapter you can quickly plug in or a <a class="link"   href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-proven-ways-in-how-to-hide-location-on-life360-for-motorola-edge-40-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >PCIe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) card adapter, which must be installed inside your PC’s case.</p><p> Internal PCIe Wi-Fi adapters can achieve much higher potential speeds than USB Wi-Fi adapters. This is due to the limits to the data transfer rate that USB has. The introduction of <a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/53587/usb-explained-all-the-different-types-and-what-theyre-used-for/" >USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> helped, as did the updates to 3.1 and 3.2, but data transfer rates still fall short of the upper limits of PCIe. Of course, if you decide on a PCIe adapter, you have to be comfortable with opening up your computer to install it.</p><p> Mac users have fewer choices when buying a Wi-Fi adapter, but there are still some good options out there. Most of our picks listed here that connect via USB will work with macOS, but make sure to check for compatibility before purchasing.</p><p> Finding a <a class="link"   href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-linguistic-edge-influential-expressions-for-leaders/" >Wi-Fi adapter that will work reliably with Linux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another matter. Several of the adapters we looked at promised Linux compatibility—but often not for modern versions of the Linux kernel—and feedback from users is mixed on whether those promises are met in real life. As such, we don’t recommend any Linux adapters below.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>13</td><td>39</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

This Wi-Fi solution features Wi-Fi 6 and <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/valuating-the-top-video-streaming-apps-for-phones-for-2024/" >Wi-Fi 6E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support, offers tri-band coverage—2.4GHz, 5GHz, and the Wi-Fi 6E-exclusive 6GHz band—and comes with blazing-fast speeds.</p><p> While the 2.4GHz data rate isn’t the fastest around, topping out at 574Mbps, Wi-Fi 6 and <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-top-20-gags-and-laughter-on-youtube-for-downtime-delight/" >Wi-Fi 6E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> transfer speeds can go up to 2402Mbps <a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/networking-iot-servers/adapters/all-series/pce-axe58bt/techspec/" >per ASUS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is impressive. That’s plenty even for downloading massive AAA games, streaming 4K videos, and any other use case you might have.</p><p> Alongside Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, you’re also getting Bluetooth 5.2, which is a pretty cool bonus. The card slots into a PCIe x1 slot, and it comes with two external antennas with <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-apply-these-techniques-to-improve-how-to-detect-fake-gps-location-on-vivo-y78plus-t1-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >gold-plated connectors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which should provide pretty solid coverage.</p><p> The ASUS PCE-AXE58BT also comes with <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-bring-playlists-down-to-youtube-the-5-best-conversion-resources/" >OFDMA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and MU-MIMO support, just don’t forget that your router has to support those features for them to work. The installation process is quite simple, with the only catch being that you have to install the latest drivers for the AX210 chip to use Wi-Fi 6E features.</p><p> You can install Intel <a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" >Driver &amp; Support Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Intel DSA) or manually download drivers for the AX210 chip <a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/204836/intel-wifi-6e-ax210-gig/downloads.html" >from Intel’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. We recommend the former option since the Intel DSA utility will automatically download and install necessary drivers and keep your drivers up to date in case a new driver update comes out.</p><p> Another thing to look out for is to disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth features in BIOS before installing the PCE-AXE58BT, in case your PC has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. If you don’t perform this step, you’re likely to be met with the good old <a class="link"   href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-innovative-approaches-to-ppt-video-captures/" >BSOD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (blue screen of death) upon turning on your PC after installing the adapter. Note that this issue mars most Wi-Fi adapters. Even if you get some other adapter on this list, make sure not to skip this step.</p><p> Talking about negatives, aside from the high price, the Wi-Fi 6E features that include using the 6GHz band <a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000059385/wireless/intel-wi-fi-6e-products.html" >only work on Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It is not only small and easily portable, but it is also impressively competent for the low price point. As a cheap way to add Wi-Fi to your computer, this little adapter is hard to beat.</p><p> Of course, a Wi-Fi adapter this inexpensive won’t be great at maintaining high data transfer speeds for gaming or dealing with large files. The T3U is rated as AC1300, meaning potential maximum speeds of 867Mbps on 5GHz and 400Mbps on 2.4GHz. While these speeds aren’t bad at all, if you’re looking to do hardcore gaming, you’ll need <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-your-vivo-x100-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/" >something more robust <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> It has a single external antenna that can be adjusted to get the best possible coverage, and the Archer T3U Plus fully supports MU-MIMO. This helps that single antenna work as effectively as possible, even on a crowded Wi-Fi network.</p><p> The range is not as good as other USB adapters on this list, and you don’t get an extension cable or a dock to help find that perfect position. That is a shame, but not unreasonable considering the price.

Netgear also ships a cradle with the adapter for ease of placement.</p><p> Moreover, it delivers excellent performance, and your computer will enjoy fast wireless internet from your router in minutes.</p><p> Unfortunately, it doesn’t work with macOS and lacks a bundled USB-C to USB-A adapter.

The third channel can also provide data transfer speeds of up to 2402Mbps, but with a much more stable connection and less network interference. You do need a <a class="link"   href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-ways-to-sync-contacts-from-apple-iphone-xr-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/" >Wi-Fi 6E router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see these top speeds, but it’s worth the investment if you’re a hardcore gamer.</p><p> This dual-antenna adapter can be configured in a couple of ways. You can attach the antenna directly to the card at the back of your PC or plug in the supplied extension cables and antenna base. This allows you to position the antenna for the best possible network reception, with the magnetic base helping to keep them fixed exactly where you want them.</p><p> The PCIe card itself is fitted with an advanced heatsink.

You might not be too concerned about adding faster Bluetooth to your PC, but even so, it is a nice feature.</p><p> As Wi-Fi 6E becomes more common and supported by more devices, the number of Wi-Fi adapters that can make use of it will increase.

If you have an older laptop, this should be a significant speed boost when compared to the internal Wi-Fi chip. These are even reasonable general Internet use speeds if you want to use the adapter to add Wi-Fi connectivity to a desktop.</p><p> The lack of an external antenna does restrict the potential coverage range. This is lessened by the addition of MU-MIMO and beamforming, but don’t expect the DWA-181 to provide the same range performance as you might get from <a class="link"   href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-rust-crashes-a-comprehensive-guide/" >an adapter with multiple antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These small Wi-Fi adapters just don’t have room for a large, efficient internal antenna, so this is not a problem exclusive to this device.</p><p> Compatibility is another point in the D-Link adapter’s favor. It is fully compatible with several versions of Windows and macOS and advertises support for version 5.6.1.5 of the Linux kernel, too. Alongside its small size, this makes it a great option for anyone wanting to upgrade the Wi-Fi capabilities of a <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/top-10-guidelines-for-breaking-through-cover-art/" >Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other single-board computer.</p><p> The final thing worth mentioning is the price. The DWA-181 is available for $20. This makes it cheap enough to be bought as a backup adapter, making it ideal for keeping in a <a class="link"   href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/discover-the-best-4-free-online-calendar-solutions-today/" >laptop bag <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in case of a Wi-Fi emergency.</p><p> If you are prepared to put up with an adapter that is a little bit bigger, some available offer slightly better performance, including this <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Cudy-WU1300S-1300Mbps-Wireless-Compatible/dp/B084FS7BWF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205967&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/804785/best-wi-fi-adapter/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >AC1300 adapter from Cudy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But as a combination of tiny size, performance, and price, the D-Link DWA-181 is hard to beat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/d-link-dwa-181-us.png"                      alt="D-Link DWA-181-US"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Small Wi-Fi Adapter</p><h5 id="D-Link-DWA-181-1"><a href="#D-Link-DWA-181-1" class="headerlink" title="D-Link DWA-181"></a>D-Link DWA-181</h5><p>Small, but perfectly formed, this micro Wi-Fi adapter will allow you to add AC1300 wireless networking to your computer without getting in your way.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/D-Link-Wireless-Internet-Supported-DWA-181-US/dp/B07YYL3RYJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205967&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/804785/best-wi-fi-adapter/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$22 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.macys.com/shop/product/d-link-dwa-181-us-mu-mimo-wi-fi-nano-usb-adapter?ID=15470347&pla_country=US&CAGPSPN=pla" >See at macys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137214/26400" target="_top" id="2137214">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137214" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137214/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-does-a-Wi-Fi-adapter-do"><a href="#What-does-a-Wi-Fi-adapter-do" class="headerlink" title="What does a Wi-Fi adapter do?"></a>What does a Wi-Fi adapter do?</h3><p> A Wi-Fi adapter is a nifty little component that grants your laptop or desktop PC wireless connection capability.Aside from Wi-Fi, most Wi-Fi adapters also come with Bluetooth.
