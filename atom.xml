They’re able to open or block the flow of electricity to turn appliances on and off. However, this only works if an appliance has a power switch that can be “On.”</p><p> In other words, if your appliance can turn on after plugging it into an outlet, it’ll work with smart plugs. If you need to press a button after plugging in an appliance to turn it on, it won’t work with a smart plug. Keep this in mind before shopping for any plug.</p><p> Smart plugs can connect to various smart assistants such as Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, HomeKit, and IFTTT. This allows you to control them with the respective voice assistant, usually through the app and by voice.</p><p> So, if you have an Echo smart speaker and want to make the most of your smart plug, look for one that supports Alexa. The same goes for other voice assistants. Smart plugs usually can work with all ecosystems, but there are exceptions!</p><p> The size of smart plugs is another important factor to consider. Some are incredibly bulky and can take up multiple AC power sockets that are next to each other. Remember that just because a smart plug is bigger doesn’t mean it’ll provide additional features or perform better.</p><p> The last thing to note is that smart plugs are essentially the same thing as smart outlets. The main difference is that smart outlets are bigger, which usually provides more sockets for you to plug in numerous appliances.</p><p> Let’s take a closer look at some of the best smart plugs on the market.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>8</td><td>35</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

We recommend going for the three-pack as you’re almost getting one for free.</p><p> We chose this as the best budget option for several reasons. For starters, it’s definitely one of the least expensive smart plugs on the market, while still providing great value. The plug requires you to have Alexa- or Google Assistant-powered devices, and it also works with IFTTT.</p><p> There’s no third-party app to download, so you need to connect it to a voice assistant, but there’s a good chance you’re using one of those anyway if you’re decking out a smart home.</p><p> Once connected, you can control the plug by voice, set timers, and create schedules. There’s even an Away mode, which turns on the plug at random times to make it seem like you’re at home. The plug uses a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signal, and it has a rectangular build. You can conveniently stack three of these on top of each other, so you can use them in standard outlets easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bradlink-smart-plug.png"                      alt="bradlink smart plug"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Budget Smart Plug</p><h5 id="BroadLink-Smart-Plug-1"><a href="#BroadLink-Smart-Plug-1" class="headerlink" title="BroadLink Smart Plug"></a>BroadLink Smart Plug</h5><p>Just need a budget smart plug that gets the job done?

<i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a <a class="link"   href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/boost-your-efficiency-at-work-with-these-chatgpt-assistant-strategies/" >PCIe port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to install one, you can connect a desktop-class GPU to your PC with the help of an external GPU enclosure. Just get a GPU, install it into the enclosure, and connect the enclosure to your PC via a <a class="link"   href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/record-games-with-no-hassle-nvidia-way/" >Thunderbolt <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port.</p><p> External GPU enclosures are simple contraptions that include just a handful of elements. First, you’ve got the enclosure itself, more or less an empty box populated by a <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/youtubes-buzzing-titles-roundup-1-8/" >power supply unit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a few other parts.</p><p> Aside from the enclosure and the PSU, you’ve also got a PCIe slot for installing the GPU, power cables needed to power the GPU, a <a class="link"   href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-quick-conversion-tips-using-vlc-for-mpeg-4-and-beyond/" >Thunderbolt 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port for connecting the eGPU enclosure to the laptop or other kind of slotless PC you want to augment (all newer models we’re focusing on in this guide come with Thunderbolt 3 support). Some eGPU enclosures also come with extra connectivity in the form of USB ports, and they can sometimes include a cooling setup made of one or a couple of case fans.</p><p> If you’re looking for an eGPU enclosure, graphics card clearance is the most important thing to focus on. Every eGPU enclosure should have a list containing supported graphics cards or the maximum GPU dimensions it supports, either on its store listing or its specs page on the manufacturer site. When some of the <a class="link"   href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/m1-pro-vs-m1-max-delving-into-the-details-of-apples-latest-cpus-for-2024/" >best graphics cards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be almost as massive as certain <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-motorola-moto-g84-5g-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >SFF enclosures <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it’s important to be absolutely certain the eGPU enclosure you’re interested in can fit the GPU you plan on getting before pulling the trigger on either.</p><p> Once you’re certain that the enclosure you’re eyeing can house your graphics card of choice, check out the PSU inside and ensure it’s powerful enough to power the GPU without issues. Don’t just focus on <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-4-ways-to-trace-vivo-x-fold-2-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >PSU wattage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>—also make sure there are enough PCIe power connectors to power the GPU. For instance, some high-end graphics cards feature three 8-pin PCIe power connectors. If the enclosure you plan on getting packs enough power for a high-end graphics card with three 8-pin power connectors—for example, 500W—but only comes with two of those connectors, you won’t be able to power that particular GPU.</p><p> Also, <a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/" >NVIDIA RTX 40 series graphics cards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, including the RTX 4070 and more powerful models, feature 12VHPWR power connectors that either require an <a class="link"   href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/battle-royale-concrete-fists-vs-digital-screens/" >ATX 3.0-compatible PSU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with 12VHPWR power cables or a 12VHPWR adapter. You should be fine if the card you want can work with a 12VHPWR adapter featuring two 8-pin PCIe connectors. On the other hand, if the card in question needs a 12VHPWR adapter with three or four 8-pin connectors, an eGPU enclosure that includes a PSU with only two 8-pin PCIe cables won’t work with that graphics card.</p><p> Fortunately, many external GPU enclosures support swapping out the prebuilt PSU unit. So, if you plan on getting a high-end GPU not supported by the enclosure you plan on buying, check whether it’s possible to swap out the PSU in the said enclosure. If it is, you can replace the PSU and use any card you want, as long as you can fit the PSU, and the GPU, inside the enclosure.</p><p> Next, let’s talk about Thunderbolt 3 connectors and extra USB ports. Firstly, despite <a class="link"   href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-from-google-pixel-8-pro-by-drfone-android/" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> being the latest iteration of the standard, you won’t find eGPU enclosures equipped with Thunderbolt 4 ports. Because both Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 top out at 40Gbps, there’s no advantage in using the newer standard with an external GPU enclosure.</p><p> Concerning extra USB ports, those can be regular USB-A or USB-C ports that only support data transfer, or they can be USB-C ports that support both data transfer and <a class="link"   href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/" >USB Power Delivery (USB PD) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In case one or more of the available USB-C ports support USB PD, the manufacturer should clearly label the maximum amount of power, in watts, delivered via the said USB-C port. You should have no trouble finding that info on the online store listing or the product webpage on the manufacturer’s website.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

The enclosure features a design that successfully mimics a compact Mini-ITX case, and we love how it looks. Thanks to the lack of snazzy details, the enclosure will look great with any laptop, NUC, or other PC that can’t house a desktop GPU.</p><p> Specs-wise, you’ve got a 650W internal PSU that can power any GPU in existence—however, only two PCIe 8-pin power connectors impose some limits on which graphics cards you can use. Luckily, the Core X supports up to three-slot GPUs up to 330mm in length, meaning you can fit most modern GPUs in there as long as you can power them with the included PSU. If the PSU is not up to snuff, you can replace it, allowing you to use high-end cards with high power requirements and GPUs with a 12VHPWR connector. The Razer Core X doesn’t come with extra connectivity, but the included Thunderbolt 3 port can power your laptop with up to 100W.</p><p> The GPU installation procedure is pretty straightforward, thanks to the sliding mechanism on the rear of the enclosure. Just pull out the folding handle, slide out the PCIe slot and cables, install the graphics card and connect it to the PSU, and then slide the whole assembly back into the enclosure. Thanks to the sliding design, you can use cards longer than the maximum length of 330mm; you just won’t be able to slide the assembly fully into the enclosure. Regarding negatives, the $400 is steep for what you’re getting, but at least it looks gorgeous and supports three-slot GPUs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/razer-core-x-2.png"                      alt="Razer Core X Product Image"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best External GPU Enclosure Overall</p><h5 id="Razer-Core-X-1"><a href="#Razer-Core-X-1" class="headerlink" title="Razer Core X"></a>Razer Core X</h5><p>Aside from extra connectivity, the Razer Core X offers everything one might need in an eGPU enclosure.

This is all for the price of $350, which is a steal for those specs.</p><p> Unfortunately, specs can’t make up for possible issues with the GPU clearance. The Sonnet eGPU enclosure supports dual slot cards up to 312mm in length, meaning you won’t be able to fit flagship GPUs that are often longer and wider than what this enclosure will support</p><p> With that said, if the GPU you’re interested in can fit inside this enclosure, the Sonnet eGPU Breakaway Box 750ex is an excellent choice due to its competitive price, attractive design, extra connectivity options, and capable PSU.</p><p> Before we move on, note that <a class="link"   href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/new-videopad-video-editor-review-and-buying-recommendation/" >M1 and M2 MacBooks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do not support external graphics cards.

The case design is almost identical, but the differences are noticeable on the rear of the enclosure and with an <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-brand-collaboration-on-youtube/" >RGB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> light bar at the bottom on the front side. It looks quite cool and isn’t over the top and gaudy like RGB implementations we’ve seen with other pieces of gaming gear.</p><p> Regarding the rear side, the Razer Core X Chroma has four extra USB-A 5Gbps ports, which can be very handy for laptops with limited connectivity options. You’re also getting a Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45) port and a Thunderbolt 3 port with 100W of USB power delivery, the only port found on the regular Core X version of the enclosure.</p><p> The final upgrade found on the Core X Chroma is a 700W PSU instead of a 650W unit. While a welcome improvement, the decision not to add a third PCIe 8-pin power connector means that you’re still limited to GPUs with two power slots and graphics cards that can work with dual 8-pin to 12VHPWR adapters.</p><p> The internal GPU clearance stayed the same compared to the Core X, meaning you can use triple-slot GPUs up to 330mm long and up to 160mm in height. We wouldn’t mind a wider design if it would mean the enclosure could fit flagship GPUs that can take up to four PCIe slots, but the current size is great for most graphics cards as is.</p><p> Concerning the price, while the regular Core X enclosure is expensive, $500 for the Chroma version is still pricey but a solid upgrade over the base model. For $100 more, you get lots of RGB, four high-speed USB ports, and an Ethernet port.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/razer-core-x-chroma-1.png"                      alt="Razer Core X Chroma RGB eGPU Enclosure Front Side"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best External GPU Enclosure for Gaming</p><h5 id="Razer-Core-X-Chroma-1"><a href="#Razer-Core-X-Chroma-1" class="headerlink" title="Razer Core X Chroma"></a>Razer Core X Chroma</h5><p>The Core X Chroma from Razer is a high-end eGPU enclosure that looks sleek, features tasteful RGB implementation, packs lots of extra connectivity, and supports massive, three slot graphics cards.

Gigabyte’s Gaming Box series of eGPUs offer the whole package. In other words, you’re getting an actual GPU inside the enclosure, and all you have to do is connect it to your computer.</p><p> The flagship model from the Gaming Box lineup is the <a class="link"   href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N4090IXEB-24GD#kf" >Gigabyte AORUS RTX 4090 Gaming Box <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which packs the most powerful consumer-grade graphics card available, the RTX 4090.

The included GPU features three DisplayPort 1.4 and a single <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/" >HDMI 2.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video output.

The Gigabyte AORUS RTX 4090 Gaming Box is also a massive-looking assembly, bigger than many SFF cases. Finally, you’ll have difficulty replacing the prebuilt GPU if you ever decide to upgrade since the custom liquid cooling system is most likely incompatible with regular graphics card designs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gigabyte-aorus-rtx-4090-gaming-box.png"                      alt="Gigabyte Aorus RTX 4090 Gaming Box Front and Sides"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best External GPU</p><h5 id="Gigabyte-Aorus-Gaming-Box-1"><a href="#Gigabyte-Aorus-Gaming-Box-1" class="headerlink" title="Gigabyte Aorus Gaming Box"></a>Gigabyte Aorus Gaming Box</h5><p>Instead of being an empty eGPU box, the Gigabyte AORUS RTX 4090 Gaming Box packs a monstrous RTX 4090, offering overkill performance no matter the workload.

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885928/19272" target="_top" id="1885928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars. The overall average rating is 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >Garmin Vivoactive 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Khj7pEOVbeqTsspKEl_3pIItgxc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GarminVivoactive53-573f048663d44d2eb0fbb8614fc6a669.jpg" >Garmin Vivoactive 5. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >$267 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most Garmin watches, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 offers all the key features while not looking too sporty.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> A Garmin Watch is the dream for active types, but they often cost a lot and rarely look great when fine dining. The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

If you’re working on a budget, you can expect to sacrifice either size, power, or both to hit your desired price point. To help you find the best option for your setup, we’ve researched and tested systems from all the top manufacturers, including Intel, Apple, Asus, and others.</p><p> Our Top Picks</p><p> Best Apple:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >Apple M2 Mac Mini at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-apple-apple-m2-mac-mini" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best Mountable:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro at Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-mountable-dell-optiplex-3070-micro" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best for Gaming:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >Origin PC Chronos at Originpc.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-for-gaming-origin-pc-chronos" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best Pocket Performance:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 at Amazon  $330 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-pocket-performance-intel-compute-stick-cs125" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Apple"><a href="#Best-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple"></a>Best Apple</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >Apple M2 Mac Mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pd8O04wozNFrXoZkq9mLvPa70OA=/fit-in/1500x1102/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Mac-mini-M2-and-M2-Pro-hero-230117-a58d050768ff412bbd48a60747d03a62.jpg" >Mac Mini M2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Apple</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >View on Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746353-REG/apple%5Fmmfj3ll%5Fa%5Fmac%5Fmini%5Fwith%5Fm2.html" >View on B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.adorama.com/acmmfj3lla.html" >$599 at Adorama.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Compact form factor</li><li>Lots of configuration options</li><li>Runs up to two 4K displays</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>High base cost</li><li>Upgrades are expensive</li><li>Integrated graphics</li></ul><p> The M2 Mac Mini is a beautiful piece of tech with impressive specifications and a high price tag. Available in various configurations, the Mac Mini comes with one HDMI 2.0 port capable of piping 4K video to your TV, and you can also hook up a second 4K display via one of the included Thunderbolt 4 ports. All models include<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for connecting to your home network, and you can even upgrade to 10GB Ethernet and a compatible high-speed network-attached storage (NAS) unit to round out your home theater experience if you like.</p><p> The best thing about the M2 Mac Mini, which makes it so well suited to the role of home theater PC, is the diminutive, unassuming case. This tiny computer is small enough to slide into just about any home theater setup, either alongside or on top of your other components, and the sleek, silver case is unlikely to clash with the rest of your gear.</p><h2 id="Best-Mountable"><a href="#Best-Mountable" class="headerlink" title="Best Mountable"></a>Best Mountable</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5Fu8oX3NbKI7TTjmNNZbexFRbMs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-optiplex-3070-desktop-computer---intel-core-i5-9500t---8gb-ram---256gb-ssd---micro-pc-4b06a3eade744016965e6f8bd76ee825.jpg" >Dell OptiPlex 3070 Desktop Computer - Intel Core i5-9500T - 8GB RAM - 256GB SSD - Micro PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&amp;publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Foptiplex-7010-small-ff%2Fs012dosffusvp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >View on Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of mounting options</li><li>Entry unit very affordable</li><li>High performance options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Mounting brackets cost extra</li><li>Only two high definition video outputs</li><li>No discrete graphics options</li></ul><p> The Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro is an excellent choice if you’re working on a budget and have space constraints. While this unit is small enough to fit into most home theater cabinets and other situations, you can mount it to the back of your VESA-compatible television with an optional bracket. Carefully route short cables behind your television and add a soundbar, and the Dell Optiplex 3070 can form the core of one of the stealthiest<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/separate-components-theater-system-setup-1846358" >home theater systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The entry-level Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro offers an excellent mix of affordability and performance, with a dual-core Pentium processor, 4GB DDR4 RAM, and a spacious 500 GB hard disk drive, all with a price tag lower than much of the competition. If you need a higher performance option, you can upgrade to a variety of Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors, add a 256GB PCIe SSD, add up to 8GB of RAM, and more.</p><p> The only real drawback of the Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro is that there isn’t any option for discrete graphics. If that isn’t important, then this line has much to offer.</p><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >Origin PC Chronos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6QzWM_zWynxfnbYZHsOGPauMkVQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/origin-pc-chronos-8f6801fc035949cda1674983b86c32e2.jpg" >Origin PC Chronos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Origin PC</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >View on Originpc.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Home theater and gaming in one package</li><li>Fantastic performance for the size</li><li>Some upgrades available</li><li>Compact design</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No free PCIe slots for upgrades</li><li>No free DIMM slots for more RAM</li><li>Manufacturer add-ons are expensive</li></ul><p> The Origin Chronos is on the larger side of PCs we recommend for home theater settings, but there’s a good reason for the exception. This PC is still significantly smaller than your typical tower unit. Yet, it’s powerful enough to run the 4K display in your home theater system and then seamlessly switch over to play many of the latest games at the highest settings. If you’re a home-theater buff who is also into PC gaming, the Origin Chronos ticks all the right boxes.</p><p> While the Chronos is a bit on the large side, gamers will be immediately comfortable with the size and form factor. It doesn’t conform precisely to the size specifications of any specific game system. Still, it doesn’t look out of place next to an Xbox One or PlayStation 4, nor will it have overstayed its welcome by the time you upgrade to the next generation of consoles.</p><p> The base configuration of the Origin Chronos comes packed with a six-core AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super, which means you can even use it with some of the best VR headsets. You can also upgrade to various more powerful<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >Intel and AMD Ryzen CPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and even slot in a beastly Nvidia GeForce3 RTX Titan if you’re looking to future-proof your home theater and gaming experiences.</p><p> The Origin Chronos is a bit pricey if you’re not looking for a home theater PC that can double as a powerful gaming rig, but it’s a fantastic option if that is what you’re looking for. It even allows you to upgrade after the fact, like a traditional PC. However, the PCIe and DIMM slots are all full from the factory, so you’ll be replacing components with upgrades rather than just adding new functionality on top.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Pocket-Performance"><a href="#Best-Pocket-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Best Pocket Performance"></a>Best Pocket Performance</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IWj-nLakAVXRcFFnwLZ_74Scfkc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/intel-compute-stick-cs125-computer-with-intel-atom-x5-processor-and-windows-10-boxstk1aw32scblack-3692e45b206b45e08473c04bcb5814d8.jpg" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 Computer with Intel Atom x5 Processor and Windows 10 (BOXSTK1AW32SC),Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >$330 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Remarkably small size</li><li>Decent performance</li><li>Affordable</li><li>Full Windows experience</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Limited memory</li><li>Some versions are expensive</li><li>No upgradeability</li><li>Some models are sluggish</li></ul><p> The Intel Compute Stick is a tiny home theater PC with a form factor that isn’t much larger than most television streaming devices. It’s designed to plug directly into one of the HDMI ports on your television, or you can use an HDMI adapter if the Compute Stick is too big.</p><p> Unlike streaming devices with a similar form factor, the Intel Compute Stick is a legitimate Windows PC. It features the whole Windows 10 experience, which means you can use this tiny home theater PC to do anything you can with any other Windows computer. You can install apps, browse the internet, and stream media for your home theater.</p><p> The Intel Compute Stick comes in a few configurations, so choosing the right one is essential. The most affordable option packs a lightweight Atom processor suitable for basic streaming, but don’t expect it to do any heavy lifting. More expensive versions are available with faster processors, all in the same tiny form factor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-devices-to-buy-for-streaming-tv-4061016" >Streaming Devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Home-Theater-PC"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Home-Theater-PC" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Home Theater PC"></a>What to Look For in a Home Theater PC</h2><h3 id="Processor"><a href="#Processor" class="headerlink" title="Processor"></a>Processor</h3><p> You’ll find home theater PCs equipped with both Intel and AMD CPUs. AMD is a fine choice if you’re after a budget model and don’t need high performance, while Intel typically provides higher performance. The latest AMD processors have flipped that script with a fantastic performance from their most expensive offerings, but you’re unlikely to make that kind of investment in a home theater PC.</p><h3 id="Graphics-Card"><a href="#Graphics-Card" class="headerlink" title="Graphics Card"></a>Graphics Card</h3><p> You need your home theater PC to have a discrete graphics card for the best performance. It doesn’t need to be powerful enough to play the latest games if you aren’t also a gamer, but it does need to be powerful enough to drive an HD or 4K display or multiple displays, depending on your configuration. If budget is more important, you may have to settle for integrated graphics.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144287/7443" target="_top" id="2144287">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144287" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144287/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Storage"><a href="#Storage" class="headerlink" title="Storage"></a>Storage</h3><p> You’ll need plenty of storage to convert your media library to digital content that you can play on your home theater PC or stream to other devices.

This addition addresses one of the RAX120’s most significant flaws—the absence of cyber security and anti-malware software.</p><p> <em>We purchased the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it.

I tested the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 to see how well it performs in the real world.</p><h2 id="Design-Batman’s-router"><a href="#Design-Batman’s-router" class="headerlink" title="Design: Batman’s router"></a><strong>Design: Batman’s router</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 has a futuristic design—angular, with clean lines. It looks like a cross between a spaceship and the Batmobile. It’s matte black and rectangular, but instead of the multiple antennas you’d typically see protruding from the top of a Nighthawk router, it has two wing-like extensions that come from each side.</p><p> The eight antennas are housed inside of the two wings, so they’re not visible. The antennas are supposed to be ideally pre-positioned for you to get the best possible connection. However, because the eight individual antennas are housed within the wings, you can’t adjust them to your liking. The wings are on hinges though, so can fold down the wings to store the router, as the unit is somewhat large and bulky. It weighs three pounds, and it measures about a foot wide and almost eight inches in depth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fw0FJuD9bAOkQEHuAZ9OFq5toXk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetGear_LongRangeRouters_Nighthawk_RAX120_05-2a03227466354aad82fe55b884b76ac6-4d18f476974a44b081aafc943a8e56b1.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX12"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137229/26400" target="_top" id="2137229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137229/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk app walks you through the setup process. There’s a QR code sticker on the router, as well as a temporary network name and password on the label, which allow you to connect quickly and easily.</p><p> The app guides you through creating separate 2.4 and 5GHz networks, but you can also take advantage of a feature called smart connect, which combines your networks and designates your devices based on optimal performance. You can create a guest network, as well as manage and monitor your devices individually. The initial setup process took me about ten minutes in total.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Superfast-speeds"><a href="#Connectivity-Superfast-speeds" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Superfast speeds"></a><strong>Connectivity: Superfast speeds</strong></h2><p> The RAX120 is a workhorse. It’s classified as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but there’s also a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >tri-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version available (the RAX200). The RAX120 supports 802.11ax, which is also known as Wi-Fi 6. Although Wi-Fi 6 is still relatively new, the addition of Wi-Fi 6 future-proofs the RAX120 to a certain degree. It allows for faster speeds, better battery life on your Wi-Fi 6 compatible and IoT devices, and less congestion on your network.</p><p> With the addition of 802.11ax, the RAX120 also supports 8-stream MU-MIMO, which means your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >wireless router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can communicate with several streaming devices at the same time without experiencing too much congestion. Support for beamforming and Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) also promotes better performance. The RAX120 is backwards compatible with 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac as well, so it’ll work with virtually all of your devices, Wi-Fi 6 or not.</p><p> The RAX120 has four Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back (two of which can be combined to support a larger file transfer rate of 2 GB) and a multigig Ethernet port that supports speeds up to 5 gigs. I was impressed overall with the location and specifications of the ports, but I would have liked to see more Ethernet ports on a router this expensive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/y2V4Ncx3Z1ul8B-4lsc_IeiyCRQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetGear_LongRangeRouters_Nighthawk_RAX120_04-9e452ddedd2b4a46893fddd147c06d4f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX12"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885928/19272" target="_top" id="1885928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-performance-Stellar"><a href="#Network-performance-Stellar" class="headerlink" title="Network performance: Stellar"></a><strong>Network performance: Stellar</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk RAX120 indicates top speeds of 1,200 Mbps on the 2.4Ghz band and 4,800 Mbps on the 5Ghz band. My Internet speed maxes out at 500 Mbps. I have about 50 connected devices, more than half of which are smart home devices like smart light switches, smart appliances, security cameras, and smart speakers and displays. The RAX120 had no problem managing my numerous smart devices, nor did I experience any lag or connectivity issues on streaming and gaming devices. I simultaneously ran a gaming computer, two playstations, and two FireTVs without the connection missing a beat.</p><p> I used the smart connect feature when testing the router’s speeds, and it did a decent job of moving me to the appropriate band as I traveled throughout my home. On an 802.11ax compatible iPhone, the Nighthawk RAX120 clocked speeds of 469 Mbps while in the same room as the router. Proximity to the router had little impact in Wi-Fi speeds, as the speeds only dropped slightly (to 455 Mbps) when I traveled to the opposite end of my 1,600 square foot home. When I went out to the backyard, however, the speeds dropped more dramatically (to 385 Mbps).</p><p> On my laptop, which is not Wi-Fi 6 compatible, the speed maxed out at 410 Mbps, and I saw a substantial drop in the backyard (to 280 Mbps), just as I saw with the phone. The router has an impressive range overall, and I didn’t experience any dead zones, which has been a problem with other routers in the past.

The options are somewhat basic, but they do provide some peace of mind, and they are helpful when paired with other parental control applications.</p><p> The RAX120 is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can use voice commands and say things like, “Alexa, ask NETGEAR to enable guest network” or “OK Google, ask NETGEAR to reboot my router.”</p><p> The router has two USB 3.0 storage ports on the back for connecting an external hard drive.</p><h2 id="Software-Nighthawk-App"><a href="#Software-Nighthawk-App" class="headerlink" title="Software: Nighthawk App"></a><strong>Software: Nighthawk App</strong></h2><p> In the Nighthawk app, you can change your router’s settings, create a guest network, control your router remotely, manage your devices individually, and you can test your network speeds.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> If you use your laptop for playing games or running high-performance apps, then you’ve probably seen it get very warm and kick on its potentially loud internal fans. However, the built-in fans can only do so much to dissipate the immense heat built within, try as they might. That’s where laptop cooling pads come in, blasting additional cool air into your laptop to help take down the internal and external temperatures.</p><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.</p><p> Kootek’s Laptop Cooling Pad isn’t the cheapest option around, nor is it the most premium—but it’s effective and sells for a reasonable price, and is large enough to accommodate larger laptops with 17-inch displays. A clunky height adjustment system is the main drawback, but it doesn’t stop the Kootek pad from working as expected.</p><h2 id="Design-Clunky-but-it-works"><a href="#Design-Clunky-but-it-works" class="headerlink" title="Design: Clunky, but it works"></a>Design: Clunky, but it works</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a larger unit, measuring nearly 15 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall, and about 1.4 inches thick, with a weight of 2.6 pounds. It’s heavier and bulkier than the lightweight TopMate C302 Cooling Pad, for example, and feels more durable as a result.</p><p> It’s built for laptops with screens between 12 and 17 inches diagonal, with a wide metal grate on the surface to help dissipate heat as the five fans blow onto your laptop. Most of the rest of the build is plastic. Each fan has red LED lighting for an added glow to the pad.</p><p> The height adjustment system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution.</p><p> Two flip-up, padded stoppers at the bottom of the surface help keep your laptop in place even when you have the pad angled, thanks to the height adjustment system. Granted, that system is easily my least favorite part of this cooling pad.</p><p> Essentially, there’s a loose metal bar hanging from the main unit of the cooling pad, and you’ll slot that into one of six ridges on the bottom stand to prop it up. The system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution. It works and it provides finer-grain height adjustment levels, but it feels like a clunky solution for a tech accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Uuby879oWyaUH6_3WN7ZssAF-g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_04-73dc23f85de34fa087b21b21461f9f74.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> There are two buttons at the back of the pad: One button controls the large, central fan (4.72 inches), while the other controls the four smaller fans (2.76 inches each). I’m not sure why you would choose to use only some fans at any given time, since they’re all quiet, but the option is there if you want it. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, meaning this cooling pad functions as a hub for plugging additional accessories into your laptop.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Very-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Very-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Very straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Very straightforward</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad doesn’t require any software or its own power unit to function. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the height as desired, and then plug the built-in USB cable into your laptop to power it on. As mentioned, you can control the fans using the buttons at the back of the pad, and the USB ports can be used for additional accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A5iJ3c7mD8guT4DKXitqb3wlp6I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_03-9ec8e6afd494441f8ae20c38ae1fadbb.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151890/7443" target="_top" id="2151890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983475">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983475">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983475%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983475/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Cool-and-quiet"><a href="#Performance-Cool-and-quiet" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Cool and quiet"></a>Performance: Cool and quiet</h2><p> I tested the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , featuring an Intel Core i7-9750H processor with 16GB RAM, along with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB). It’s a solidly powerful gaming laptop, and I put it to the test with a couple of popular games as well as a graphics benchmark test.</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid impact in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite.</p><p> I recorded the internal temperature using NZXT’s CAM app and the external temperature with a infrared thermometer, first with the laptop by itself. After it cooled down, I tested again with the cooling pad equipped the whole time.</p><p> In racing game Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade put up an internal processor temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit and external temperature of 117 degrees, but peaked at 169 degrees internal and 107 degrees external with the Kootek pad equipped. The average frame rate was nearly identical between tests, with no significant difference from the use of the cooling pad.</p><p> Meanwhile, I saw a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees when playing Fortnite, along with an external temperature of 118 degrees. With the cooling pad equipped, I saw a slightly lower internal peak of 192 degrees, although it mostly hovered in the 160 to 170-degree range during testing. The external peak with the Kootek pad was 106 degrees. Curiously, I saw the exact same numbers with the Heaven graphics benchmark test with and without the cooling pad: 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees external.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ppFnQ9kEpjbEV9cYbHzLRI5j-j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_05-4a4d5ee065a94c3e984ae0c96f4916d8.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid effort in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite, although the cheaper, dual-fan TopMate C302 cooling pad saw slightly better overall results. Your experience may vary depending on your laptop of choice, however. All the while, the Kootek pad stayed pretty quiet in stark contrast to the Razer Blade’s own very loud internal fans.</p><h2 id="Price-Entirely-reasonable"><a href="#Price-Entirely-reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Entirely reasonable"></a>Price: Entirely reasonable</h2><p> At $26 from Amazon, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops. There are cheaper options out there, as well as some with additional features such as temperature sensors and additional fan controls, but Kootek’s device delivers good functionality for the price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/30UKekQcQjJ1mpixthV5avHNZsE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_02-9e1418002e754b2c8e01cb12f766975a.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302"><a href="#Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302" class="headerlink" title="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302"></a>Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302</h2><p> As mentioned above, the TopMate C302 is a lighter, simpler cooling pad option. It’s designed for laptops up to 15 inches in size and isn’t quite as thick or heavy, but it gets the job done with effective cooling and straightforward design. Kootek’s pad offers an additional USB port for accessories, though, and allows for more height variance than the TopMate’s basic pop-out feet.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good all-around option.</strong></p><p> A clunky design makes the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad a bit awkward in use, but ultimately it does a solid job of cooling hot laptops and accommodating larger-sized devices. The extra USB ports are handy, especially for port-limited laptops, and the price is reasonable.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  Kootek</li><li>MPN  LCP05</li><li>Price  $35.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2018</li><li>Weight  2.91 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 11.8 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Ports  USB-A x2</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-innovative-tips-for-audio-addition-to-powerpoint-decks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Innovative Tips for Audio Addition to PowerPoint Decks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-compreeved-list-of-non-bandicamp-capture-software-on-mac/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Compreeved List of Non-Bandicamp Capture Software on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-cross-platform-soundtrack-strategy-for-facebook-profiles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Cross-Platform Soundtrack Strategy for Facebook Profiles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/assessing-the-accuracy-of-chatgpt-and-bard-for-budgets/"><u>Assessing the Accuracy of ChatGPT and Bard for Budgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-setting-up-outlook-preview-for-w10w11/"><u>Comprehensive Guide: Setting up Outlook Preview for W10/W11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/ergodriven-topo-evaluation-the-ultimate-standing-desk-mat-against-fatigue/"><u>ErgoDriven Topo Evaluation: The Ultimate Standing Desk Mat Against Fatigue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/estrategias-efectivas-para-reducir-el-tamano-de-videos-grandes-en-facebook/"><u>Estrategias Efectivas Para Reducir El Tamaño De Videos Grandes en Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/high-definition-home-entertainment-showdown-apple-tv-4k-vs-roku-ultra/"><u>High-Definition Home Entertainment Showdown: Apple TV 4K Vs.

It’s slim, lightweight, and relatively sleek at just 8.6 pounds. Its dimensions are 28.8 inches wide, 19 inches tall, and 6.8 inches deep. While it’s classified in the 32-inch class, the screen size measures just below that at 31.5 inches on the diagonal.</p><p> Despite its small size, you’ll find a generous number of connectivity options, including three HDMI ports, a USB 2.0 port, and as well as a headphone jack, A&#x2F;V and antenna inputs, and optical digital audio output. Unlike other Roku TVs, the power cord attached to the back of the device isn’t very long. This might limit your placement, but it does make losing the power cord less of an issue, and if you’re working with a restricted space, the short cord may be a non-issue anyway.</p><p> The remote follows suit in terms of simplicity and unassuming size. There are four shortcut buttons featured at the bottom of the remote to take users directly to Netflix, Sling, Hulu, or Amazon. And like all Roku remotes with volume controls, the buttons—including a mute button—are located on the right side of the wand. This makes for easy and fast access and enhances the already comfortable and intuitive feel of the remote in the hand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/i8WT_Adcb2duhlkuyqkHHMEqYN0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4118401-4-3d81bce6f0e9492aa94a23fd02e693bc.jpg"                      alt="TCL 32S325 32-inch 720p Roku Smart LED TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Uncomplicated-but-a-little-sluggish"><a href="#Setup-Process-Uncomplicated-but-a-little-sluggish" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Uncomplicated but a little sluggish"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Uncomplicated but a little sluggish</strong></h2><p> You would expect a 32-inch TV to be easy to handle. And this petite and almost weightless device doesn’t disappoint. It’s a cinch to set up and doesn’t require another person to move around. Attaching the two TV stand legs took less than a minute, but there is also the option of mounting this television as long as you purchase a VESA 100 x 100 wall mount with 8-millimeter screws.</p><p> Once we attached the stands, plugged the TV in, and placed the batteries in the remote, we were good to go through the straightforward Roku setup steps. This simple guided process is the same as we’ve seen across other Roku TVs and streaming devices. Since we have an existing Roku account, all we had to do was log in to register and activate this device.</p><p> While there’s nothing complicated about this initial setup, we did notice that the overall installation and update time was noticeably more sluggish than we’ve experienced with other Roku streaming devices and TVs. Still, within a matter of five minutes or less, we had the TV unboxed and ready for viewing. That’s about as plug-and-play as it gets.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Impressive-and-customizable"><a href="#Image-Quality-Impressive-and-customizable" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Impressive and customizable"></a><strong>Image Quality: Impressive and customizable</strong></h2><p> As soon as we started streaming content, we were impressed by the picture quality. Across the board on platforms including Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu, the colors appeared relatively punchy and vibrant. The handy asterisk button on the remote brings up a menu of picture settings right within the content you’re viewing, which is a helpful way to understand what impact your changes are making. There was no blip in streaming quality when we played around with these settings either.</p><p> Across the board on platforms including Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu, the colors appeared relatively punchy and vibrant.</p><p> This TV doesn’t get very bright, which could be an issue if you have a lot of natural light filtering into your space. We appreciated the ability to both brighten and darken the picture in very bright and low-light conditions. This did make a slight difference when viewing content in a sunny room. Along with altering the brightness levels, there are also several picture modes to consider. Normal is the standard mode, but the other options include Movie, Sports, Vivid, and Low Power. Movie mode seems to have the best effect in both dark and bright rooms, rendering the most realistic color. Sports and vivid modes tend to deliver an oversaturated picture that looks artificial.</p><p> Beyond these basic configurations, you can also tweak the image quality a step further in the advanced picture settings. Dynamic contrast is off by default, but you can set it to low or high if you want to adjust the backlight when streaming content. You can also adjust the backlight directly along with contrast levels and even the color temperature for cooler or warmer tones—or opt for normal, which falls somewhere between the two.</p><p> As soon as we started streaming content, we were impressed by the picture quality.</p><p> While none of these settings yield out-of-this-world picture quality, the viewing experience is pleasantly nuanced and customizable. The only issue we had was that at times the picture just looked too small, especially in close-up shots that gave the appearance that people’s heads were clipped even more than intended. Changing the default picture size setting from the normal setting, which zooms in slightly to reduce noisy edges, to the default setting—which eliminates any zooming—made a very slight difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A-BPt2kvOPN7lnYsYrwB1yi6mCg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4118401-3-90620926f31e4fb89f7d4fb47c95bf98.jpg"                      alt="TCL 32S325 32-inch 720p Roku Smart LED TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148649/16836" target="_top" id="2148649">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148649" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148649/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Decent-for-the-size"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Decent-for-the-size" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Decent for the size"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Decent for the size</strong></h2><p> Like picture quality, sound is surprisingly powerful despite the size of this device. The built-in 5-watt speakers deliver relatively full sound that can get quite loud. The sound settings aren’t as robust as the picture settings. By default, the volume mode is set to off, which means the sound quality is automatically set based on the content. But you can opt for leveling to even out high and low sounds, or night mode, which allows you to set the maximum volume. We did notice some issues with extreme lows and highs, but turning on the leveling option did seem to help smooth out the dips.</p><p> Like picture quality, sound is surprisingly powerful despite the size of this device.</p><h2 id="Software-Clean-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Clean-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Clean and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Clean and easy to use</strong></h2><p> The Roku OS is one of the most straightforward streaming platform interfaces out there. The menu is uncluttered and it’s easy to toggle through and locate general settings.</p><p> Everything starts with the home screen which displays the various inputs and outputs available to you at the top, followed by the streaming apps you’ve installed. You can even customize the way the tiles appear on your Home screen by simply pressing the asterisk button and selecting the Move option. The asterisk is really a multipurpose button for moving apps, deleting them, and adding them to your collection. We appreciate how this simple arrangement of apps can help provide fast access to the apps we use the most, assuming they’re outside the four shortcut buttons on the remote.</p><p> While the included remote does not have a built-in voice assistant, this TCL Roku TV is compatible with Amazon<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , provided you have a supported device. You can also scratch the voice control itch, if you have one, by using the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to search for content. The only drawback is that you can’t automatically launch content from the app.</p><p> The mobile app remote offers all the main controls the wand offers, and even offers a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-keyboard-2618153" >keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option for easy typing rather than having to toggle through the on-screen keyboard in streaming apps. This is great in theory, but we couldn’t get the keyboard to work in all apps. Even so, we noticed the mobile app remote performed much faster than the actual remote in terms of scrolling through content and exiting apps. The other great touch with the mobile app is the ability to plug in headphones to your phone and have your own private audio and viewing experience. This could be helpful if you’re trying not to disturb neighbors or a partner who doesn’t feel like listening to whatever you’re watching.</p><p> The app did disconnect from the TV once or twice for no apparent reason while we were in private listening mode, but easily reconnected. And in terms of other performance issues, we noticed launching apps took an average of 10 seconds on the initial load, which isn’t very speedy. But loading times were much faster with repeated launches. We did also notice some sluggish responses to remote prompts when toggling through some apps—Netflix in particular.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-One-of-the-least-expensive-smart-TVs-on-the-market"><a href="#Price-One-of-the-least-expensive-smart-TVs-on-the-market" class="headerlink" title="Price: One of the least expensive smart TVs on the market"></a><strong>Price: One of the least expensive smart TVs on the market</strong></h2><p> The suggested retail price for the TCL 32S325 is only $169.99. That’s quite a steal given the strengths of this device. As smart TVs continue to add on assets like HDR and 4K picture quality, prices increase considerably the higher you go in size. There aren’t many new 32-inch smart TVs on the market at this price and for the feature set. If you want a full 1080p TV, the Sony KDL32W600D 32-Inch HD Smart TV is a few years older and retails for around $300. The Samsung 32-inch Class N5300 1080p Smart LED TV retails for slightly less at around $250. Still, given the above-average picture and sound and usability of the TCL 32S325, it’s an affordable and compelling smart TV option for compact living quarters.</p><h2 id="Competition-Image-quality-and-streaming-experience"><a href="#Competition-Image-quality-and-streaming-experience" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Image quality and streaming experience"></a><strong>Competition: Image quality and streaming experience</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U3FPN4U/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4770825%7Cncfc38569fd3147fcafac843c593d9fdd02%7C" >Fire TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is perhaps the most direct competitor to the Roku TV, and the closest match to the TCL 32S325 is the $180 Toshiba Amazon Fire TV Edition in the 32-inch class. Of course, instead of the Roku platform, this model operates on the Fire OS, which features Prime content and a significantly more cluttered interface than the Roku OS. Picture quality may also fall short of what you’ll see in the Roku 32-inch Smart TV.</p><p> If you want really impressive image quality, the Samsung 32-inch Class N5300 Smart Full HD TV is a worthy competitor. It’s nearly identical in size, but boasts two times the picture quality of standard HD TVs, with particular attention to delivering realistic color and details like shadows and contrast. If you’re not necessarily married to either the Roku or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-fire-os-4582380" >Fire OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> interfaces, the Samsung TV presents as a straightforward way to add the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-streaming-how-it-works-1999513" >streaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> services you use. The list price is about $80 more than the TCL 32S325, but if you’re a fan of Samsung products and own a Samsung phone, the image quality and easy syncing and connectivity might make this worth the slight bump in price.</p><p> If you’d like to compare this small smart TV with other options, both large and small, take a look at our lists of the best budget TVs and best Roku TVs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Compact but brimming over with value.</strong></p><p> The TCL 32S325 32-inch 720p Roku Smart LED TV (2019) is certainly small, but it’s mighty when it comes to value. This inexpensive HD TV doesn’t boast the most astonishing picture quality, but the solid viewing experience, smart features, and ease of use make for a value-rich plug-and-play smart TV. It blends in and won’t overwhelm dorm rooms, studio apartments, or smaller rooms in your home.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  32S325 32-Inch 720p Roku Smart LED TV</li><li>Product Brand  TCL</li><li>MPN  32S325</li><li>Price  $127.88</li><li>Weight  8.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  28.8 x 19 x 6.8 in.</li><li>Screen Size  31.5 inches</li><li>Platform  Roku OS</li><li>Screen Resolution  720 pixels (1366 x 768)</li><li>Ports  3 HDMI, 1 Composite Audio&#x2F;Video, 1 Digital Optical Audio, Headphone Jack, RF Antenna, 1 USB 2.0</li><li>Speakers  5 watts</li><li>Connectivity Options  Built-in Wi-Fi</li><li>Compatibility  Alexa, Google Assistant</li><li>Warranty  One year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cutting-edge-mp4-transformer-share-to-facebook/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Cutting-Edge MP4 Transformer Share to Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-planning-a-dynamic-tiktok-outro-experience/"><u>[New] Planning a Dynamic TikTok Outro Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-reimagining-game-logging-with-no-fbx-technology/"><u>[New] Reimagining Game Logging with No-FBX Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-leap-into-fitness-a-curated-selection-of-vr-treadmill-pros/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Leap Into Fitness A Curated Selection of VR Treadmill Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-critical-appraisal-of-the-google-pixel-6-breakdown-of-camera-quality-and-more/"><u>A Critical Appraisal of the Google Pixel 6: Breakdown of Camera Quality and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/asus-ac68u-router-evaluation-fast-and-fortified-with-advanced-5g-connectivity/"><u>Asus AC68U Router Evaluation: Fast & Fortified with Advanced 5G Connectivity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/effortless-digital-workflow-wacoms-tablet-driver-free/"><u>Effortless Digital Workflow: Wacom's Tablet Driver [Free]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/exclusive-analysis-of-the-netgear-nighthawk-rax120-speeds-that-outshine-all-competitors/"><u>Exclusive Analysis of the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120: Speeds That Outshine All Competitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/reviewing-the-updated-microsoft-surface-pro-7-superior-performance-retained-with-minor-adjustments/"><u>Reviewing the Updated Microsoft Surface Pro 7 - Superior Performance Retained with Minor Adjustments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ltimate-checklist-for-post-editing-and-uploading-your-360-vids-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Checklist for Post-Editing & Uploading Your 360 Vids on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-unfreeze-fortnite-top-troubleshooting-steps/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Unfreeze Fortnite : Top Troubleshooting Steps</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Canon PowerShot SX70 HS is one of those rare cameras that seems to do everything well, with only a few minor caveats.</p><p> It has a respectable 65X zoom range from 21-1365mm (35mm equivalent), which allows you to capture everything from landscapes and portraits to close-up photos of wildlife and sporting events. It is compact, solidly built, and one of the most ergonomic cameras you can buy.</p><p> We put the PowerShot SX70 HS to the test to see if its performance justifies its premium price.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Design-Built-to-last-great-to-use"><a href="#Design-Built-to-last-great-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Design: Built to last, great to use"></a><strong>Design: Built to last, great to use</strong></h2><p> The SX70 HS is a tiny little camera considering the zoom range it packs in, yet it never felt too small in our hands. The exterior is composed of grippy texturized plastic and features a generous leather grip. We never worried about dropping it, and it feels tough enough to take the odd jolt and jostle in stride.</p><p> Obvious care and attention to detail have gone into every aspect of the control layout, and the camera can easily and intuitively be manipulated one-handed. One of the things we liked best was the location of the power button, which is situated to the left of the mode selector dial. This keeps it within easy reach but makes it almost impossible to accidentally power the camera on or off.</p><p> Obvious care and attention to detail have gone into every aspect of the control layout.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-cables-and-connectors-what-you-need-to-know-4685377" >Mini HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Remote shutter, USB, and microphone ports are included, though unfortunately for audio monitoring, the SX70 HS lacks a headphone jack and hot shoe mount. The port covers are durable and easy to use, and we appreciated the well-placed location of the 3.5mm microphone jack.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Get-charged-up-and-you’re-ready-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-Get-charged-up-and-you’re-ready-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Get charged up and you’re ready to go"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Get charged up and you’re ready to go</strong></h2><p> We found it easy enough to set up the SX70 HS and start shooting. Language, time, and date options are presented upon initial startup. The battery charges externally in an included wall charger and takes only a few hours to power up completely from empty.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-life-No-worries"><a href="#Battery-life-No-worries" class="headerlink" title="Battery life: No worries"></a><strong>Battery life: No worries</strong></h2><p> Even after extended use, we had barely scratched the surface of the SX70 HS’s considerable battery life. It was still going strong after shooting dozens of photos and video clips, so you won’t have to worry about running out of battery life in the middle of a trip.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Display-and-Viewfinder-Saturated-and-clear"><a href="#Display-and-Viewfinder-Saturated-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Display and Viewfinder: Saturated and clear"></a><strong>Display and Viewfinder: Saturated and clear</strong></h2><p> The three-inch, 920,000-dot screen on the SX70 HS looks amazing—perhaps_too_ amazing, as your photos will look better on it than on your phone or computer. The screen is fully articulating and solidly built. Our one complaint would be how easily it picks up smudges, and how difficult those smudges are to remove. An advantage of the articulating screen is that it can be turned face-in to avoid dirt and damage and to save on battery life.</p><p> The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is bright and clear with 2,360,000 dots. It’s not the best EVF we’ve ever used as it seems slightly small and cramped, but it gets the job done. A sensor automatically detects when you put your eye up to it (a function that can be adjusted in the settings), which means you don’t have to hunt for a button to switch the EVF on.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Autofocus-Blazing-fast"><a href="#Autofocus-Blazing-fast" class="headerlink" title="Autofocus: Blazing fast"></a><strong>Autofocus: Blazing fast</strong></h2><p> We were shocked by how fast and consistent the autofocus is in the SX70 HS, even in low-light situations. It rarely fails to lock on to your intended subject, and focus tracking works flawlessly.</p><p> The autofocus is really one of the standout features of the SX70 HS—it makes the camera ideal for anyone who will be photographing fast and erratic subjects. Whether you’re capturing precious family moments, sporting events, or wildlife, the SX70 HS will really help ensure you get the shot when it counts the most.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Photo-Quality-Great-colors-average-resolution"><a href="#Photo-Quality-Great-colors-average-resolution" class="headerlink" title="Photo Quality: Great colors, average resolution"></a><strong>Photo Quality: Great colors, average resolution</strong></h2><p> We love the warm, natural color tone that<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-new-canon-cameras-493499" >Canon cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> produce, and the SX70 HS doesn’t disappoint. Its photos are vibrant and it captures particularly nice portraits.</p><p> The SX70 HS performs well throughout its zoom range of 21-1365mm and can capture good images even in low-light situations. We found that like most cameras with small (1&#x2F;2.3”) high resolution (20.3 MP) sensors, the SX70 HS does not perform well at high ISOs. It goes as high as ISO 3200, but we wouldn’t recommend shooting above ISO 800.</p><p> RAW files are rich and detailed, and JPEG images are well-rendered</p><p> It is worth noting the exceptional image stabilization implemented in the SX70 HS. It utilizes a dual stabilization system where both the lens and the sensor are shifted to counter unwanted movement and allow for slower shutter speeds (and smoother video). As a result, you can avoid high ISOs and still get sharp photos.</p><p> The SX70 HS has strong macro photography capabilities and a minimum focusing distance of zero. This is very impressive, and we found that this camera delivers excellent close-up images.</p><p> RAW files are rich and detailed, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jpeg-myths-and-facts-1701548" >JPEG images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are well-rendered, though JPEG images do show the compression artifacts typical of point-and-shoot cameras. The built-in flash raises and lowers manually and is functional if unexceptional.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151860/7443" target="_top" id="2151860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modes-Plenty-to-choose-from-and-only-some-are-useful"><a href="#Modes-Plenty-to-choose-from-and-only-some-are-useful" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Plenty to choose from (and only some are useful)"></a><strong>Modes: Plenty to choose from (and only some are useful)</strong></h2><p> The SX70 HS includes the standard Auto, Program, Shutter Priority (Tv), Aperture Priority (Av), and Manual modes, accessible via the top mode dial. Additionally, you will find two video modes: one that opens up more advanced video features, and one that shoots short video clips followed by a still photo. That second mode is quite odd, and we found that it did not produce good results.</p><p> The camera also has a Panorama mode that produces good results, but it’s severely limited in its options— it can only take horizontal panoramas in a right-hand direction. Also included are a Sports mode, a Filter mode (black and white, sepia, etc.), and a Scene mode.</p><p> Scene mode offers Smooth Skin, which, as it sounds, smooths the appearance of skin in a very artificial looking way, Self Portrait (identical to Smooth Skin), Portrait, Fireworks, and an unusual Food mode that supposedly makes food look fresh.</p><p> But perhaps the most useful Scene mode is “Handheld Night Scene.” This setting takes a series of photos and combines them together to produce sharp photos in dark conditions while keeping noise to a minimum, and it works impressively well.</p><p> A problem with all these automated modes and scene settings is that the images they produce are exclusively JPEG, with RAW being unavailable. Fortunately, Program mode is essentially the same as Auto, and you can enable RAW image recording there.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-Quality-A-mixed-bag"><a href="#Video-Quality-A-mixed-bag" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: A mixed bag"></a><strong>Video Quality: A mixed bag</strong></h2><p> The SX70 HS fumbles a bit when it comes to video. It’s no slouch by any means, but the footage is nothing to brag about. You can record up to 4K resolution, but unfortunately, the camera has to crop in to record at this resolution. Also, we found that footage is never especially sharp compared to other cameras.</p><p> On the bright side, the SX70 HS provides excellent Canon color rendition, so even if your footage isn’t sharp, it will still look reasonably attractive.</p><p> Timelapse mode is where the SX70 HS really shines in terms of video.</p><p> Despite the slightly disappointing video quality, this is potentially a good choice for vloggers thanks to its flip-out screen that lets you view yourself while filming. The inclusion of an external microphone port is also a nice touch.</p><p> Time-lapse mode is where the SX70 HS really shines in terms of video. You can easily access this mode via the menu system, and there is a wide range of customizable options available. For those not experienced with time-lapse video, you can simply select from one of three subject-based settings. Time-lapses can be recorded at up to 4K resolution and truly excellent quality.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> The camera comes with Canon’s Digital Photo Professional software for editing. Canon also has a number of free programs available for download on its website, including Eos Movie Utility for video editing. Though Canon’s software is relatively basic, it’s quite capable for basic editing.</p><p> The SX70 HS includes excellent Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options that you can easily access via a dedicated button on top of the camera. You can connect the camera to your phone via Canon’s app to transfer images and remotely control the camera, or you can connect directly to a computer and transfer images to it wirelessly.</p><p> There is also the option to connect to a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-canon-printers-4584899" >Canon printer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and print your images directly from the camera. We found these features useful but also something of a hassle, since the process of connecting devices to the camera is pretty tedious.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Price-Big-brand-big-price-tag"><a href="#Price-Big-brand-big-price-tag" class="headerlink" title="Price: Big brand, big price tag"></a><strong>Price: Big brand, big price tag</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $549, the SX70 HS isn’t cheap (though you can often find it for $50-$100 less). However, considering the overall high quality of this camera, the premium price is at least somewhat justified.</p><p> You can find similar image quality in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ultra-zoom-cameras-493676" >other superzoom cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that cost much less, and it does seem that to some extent you are paying extra for the Canon brand name.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Dominating-from-the-middle-ground"><a href="#Competition-Dominating-from-the-middle-ground" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Dominating from the middle ground"></a><strong>Competition: Dominating from the middle ground</strong></h2><p> Canon hasn’t tried to push any boundaries with the SX70 HS. Instead, it plays it safe and just does everything very well. Two of its main competitors in the superzoom arena, Panasonic and Nikon, offer intriguing alternatives by either cutting costs or offering groundbreaking technological advances.</p><p> The Nikon COOLPIX P1000, for example, has an incredible 125x zoom range, as well as a staggering array of extra features. But it also comes with an MSRP of $999—twice what the Canon costs—and is not so sturdily built. The SX70 HS also boasts much better image stabilization and autofocus.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nikon-coolpix-p1000-review-4691097" >Nikon COOLPIX P1000 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The Panasonic Lumix DC-FZ80, on the other hand, has an MSRP of $399 but usually sells for less than $300. Even with this lower price point, it is in many ways the equal of the SX70 HS. In terms of image quality, it actually exceeds the Canon. But it has a shorter (60x) zoom range and is much more cheaply made, with a shorter battery life.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A tremendously fun camera that is exceedingly well-rounded if a bit pricey.</strong></p><p> For a general-purpose point-and-shoot, the Canon Powershot SX70 HS is hard to beat. It has great build quality and lightning-fast autofocus, and despite a few minor flaws, it just about manages to justify its premium cost—if you can find it on sale, then it makes an even better buy.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/panasonic-lumix-dc-fz80-review-4691071" >Panasonic Lumix DC-FZ80 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-sx530-review-4772573" >Canon PowerShot SX530 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-elph-190-review-4589522" >Canon PowerShot ELPH 190 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  PowerShot SX70</li><li>Product Brand  Canon</li><li>UPC  3071C001AA</li><li>Price  $549.99</li><li>Weight  1.34 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  5 x 4.6 x 3.6 in.</li><li>Zoom  65x optical zoom, 4x digital zoom</li><li>Sensor  1&#x2F;2.3” CMOS, 20.3MP</li><li>Recording Quality  3849 x 2169: 29.97 fps</li><li>Aperture range  f&#x2F;3.4 (W), f&#x2F;6.5 (T)</li><li>Burst shooting  10 shots&#x2F;sec</li><li>Screen  3” TFT Color Vari-angle LCD, 920,000 dots</li><li>Viewfinder  Electronic Viewfinder, 2.36 million dots</li><li>Ports  Micro HDMI, USB 2.0 Micro-B, Remote shutter release</li><li>Connectivity options  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-methods-for-preserving-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Innovative Methods for Preserving YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/end-the-saga-how-to-smoothly-sync-chromebook-files-in-windows/"><u>End the Saga: How to Smoothly Sync Chromebook Files in Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/explore-the-ideal-mac-companion-mouse/"><u>Explore the Ideal Mac Companion Mouse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/gamers-blueprint-optimal-laptop-configurations/"><u>Gamer's Blueprint: Optimal Laptop Configurations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/gaming-voice-alteration-techniques-selecting-the-optimal-solution-for-2024/"><u>Gaming Voice Alteration Techniques Selecting the Optimal Solution for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/garmin-vivosmart-3-fitness-tracker-stay-active-with-built-in-music-player/"><u>Garmin Vivosmart 3 Fitness Tracker - Stay Active with Built-In Music Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-asus-rog-phone-7-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track Asus ROG Phone 7 Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-conquer-the-crowd-reach-your-goal-of-1k-insta-admirers-monthly/"><u>In 2024, Conquer the Crowd Reach Your Goal of 1K Insta Admirers Monthly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-xs-max-when-we-dont-have-apple-id-or-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone XS Max When We Dont Have Apple ID or Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/los-maximos-extractores-de-dvd-libres-y-de-fuente-abierta-para-computadoras-apple-actualizacion-de-2024/"><u>Los Máximos Extractores De DVD Libres Y De Fuente Abierta Para Computadoras Apple (Actualización De 2024)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/ls-0013-launch-error-debugged-easy-fixes-for-a-smooth-start-in-fortnite-gameplay/"><u>LS-0013 Launch Error Debugged - Easy Fixes for a Smooth Start in Fortnite Gameplay</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

touchscreen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Awkward setup process</li></ul><p> Fujitsu’s ScanSnap iX1600 is everything you could hope for in a scanner. The all-in-one device offers several new and improved features, explaining why this is now Fujitsu’s flagship scanner. Unlike its well-liked predecessor, the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500, the iX1600 includes a sizable 4.3-inch touchscreen display, faster scanning speeds, and improved software to accelerate your workflow.</p><p> It’s more than just speedy, too. The ScanSnap iX1600 offers up to 30 customizations and can connect from almost anywhere. That includes connecting wirelessly or wired, with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-b-connector-2626033" >USB Type-B connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Wi-Fi (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-5-ghz-wifi-better-than-2-4-ghz-818293" >2.4Ghz&#x2F;5Ghz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) capability, and Bluetooth connectivity. Thanks to so many connection options, creating individual users and separate profiles is possible depending on the scenario.</p><p> However, while the functionality is impressive, the setup could be more comfortable on mobile devices. Our reviewer says, “The mobile apps could use some polish, but the computer app works great for setting up all your profiles.” The iX1600 also scans a receipt destined for Dropbox, converts a document into an email, and transforms an array of physical documents into digital files with varying destinations.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : Yes |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner, copier</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4MbkC2b3SzNKg75xBrsYPIC1wOw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1600_03-83aeb941d40c4cd980e14cbc3cf08b9d.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1600-review-5115487" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1600 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Photos"><a href="#Best-for-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Best for Photos"></a>Best for Photos</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >Epson Perfection V39 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KDKAnJgG-DjrSaVRcEJTmv1ENAI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/epson-perfection-v39-46ba3e522a254eb09a078e416af72191.jpg" >Epson Perfection V39 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Epson-Perfection-V39-Color-Photo-and-Document-Scanner-Black/45100053?slfpid=3" >$160 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/208634/Epson-Perfection-V39-Color-Scanner/" >$120 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Ability to scan large documents</li><li>Easy to store</li><li>Cloud storage support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Unable to scan film</li><li>No auto document feeder</li></ul><p> If you need a scanner specifically for photos, the Epson Perfection V39 lives up to its name. The flatbed scanner is affordable and precise, producing digital documents with a 4,800<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dpi-in-graphics-1078848" >dpi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> optical resolution.</p><p> Once you’ve scanned your document or photo, you can send it directly to an email address or cloud storage like Evernote or Google Drive. If you want to scan, save, and archive aging family photos or important documents without spending a fortune, the V39 is the ideal option. The scanner also has a removable lid to conveniently scan large and bulky items such as books, making it a portable photocopier ideal for students. It’s storage-friendly, too, thanks to its well-designed build and an integrated kickstand that means you can store it vertically.</p><p> The downside? There’s no auto-document feeder, so scanning many documents can take a while. It’s also unable to scan film and is not the fastest. Still, it’s very convenient despite those flaws.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><h2 id="Best-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Best-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Best Ease of Use"></a>Best Ease of Use</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/shwDwHz8Q0pXgE35e7eq1SIgN0M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-13556924310542afa6aaad1791081047.jpg" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >$350 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-iX1400-Document-scanner-Dual-CIS-Duplex-8-5-x-118-600-dpi-40-ppm-mono-color-ADF-50-sheets-USB-3-2-Gen-1x1/145008599" >$350 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.staples.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-pa03820-b235-duplex-desktop-document-scanner-black/product%5F24478072?cid=AFF:24478072&slfpid=3" >$350 at Staples <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Individual scanning profiles</li><li>Fast scanning speed</li><li>50-sheet automatic document feeder</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No wireless connectivity</li><li>No built-in touchscreen</li></ul><p> The Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 lacks the premium features of the iX1600, but it’s still handy. While there’s frustratingly no wireless connectivity or a built-in touchscreen, its scanning features are nearly indistinguishable from the pricier alternative.</p><p> Whether you’re scanning a business card, receipt, invoice, contract, or beloved photo, the iX1400 does so speedily. Our reviewer Gannon says he “didn’t come across a single time when the scanner felt as though it was trying to play catch up with my computer—even when working with large, high-DPI scans of photographic prints.”</p><p> That’s because the ScanSnap iX1400 scans at an impressive 40-page-per-minute (PPM) speed with a 50-sheet automatic document feeder, ensuring that batch scanning is effortless. The thoughtful design and excellent Fujitsu ScanSnap Home software make smooth scanning possible. The software makes it simple to create individual scanning profiles that you can toggle on as and when needed.</p><p> A single button triggers scanning with customization, meaning you can guarantee your scanned document lands in the correct location.  </p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0IeAW5kutDfn_eYGc0eXeSayCwo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1400_02-4ca641314f2840e3888e50fb6c94b194.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1400"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-review-5115474" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Budget"><a href="#Best-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget"></a>Best Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >Canon CanoScan LiDE400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J5mTovLvmWXCmF09qL52fgsreAw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/canon-canoscan-lide400-3be6a43b477343b282e4a6aea8be5718.jpg" >Canon CanoScan LiDE400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >$78 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Canon-CanoScan-LiDE-400-2996C002-4800-x-4800dpi-Color-48-bit-Internal-24-bit-External-USB-Type-C-One-Cable-For-Data-Power-Interface-Flatbed-Scanner/296175479?slpfid=3" >$99 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1428261-REG/canon%5F2996c002%5Fcanoscan%5Flide%5F400%5Fcolor.html/?BI=98&kw=CAL400&slfpid=3" >$81 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Auto-scan mode</li><li>Maximum DPI for clear scans</li><li>Compact size</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Setup process for Mac users is challenging</li></ul><p> The Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a highly affordable yet effective scanner. It offers an impressive set of features for the price, including the ability to scan directly to cloud storage.</p><p> Wherever you plan to send your files, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400’s auto-scan mode will detect the size of your documents and adjust accordingly, saving you some effort. It’ll also scan to a maximum of 4800x4800 dpi, guaranteeing precise and accurate digital scans. Buttons on the front of the scanner make scanning even more manageable, with the scanner boasting 8-second speeds.</p><p> Once scanned, it can create PDFs that can be saved directly to your computer’s hard drive. It’s all wonderfully straightforward and convenient, although there are some issues with its Mac setup process. Stick with it, though, and it pays off.</p><p> Beyond the features and price tag, there’s also the usual one-year warranty plus a year’s worth of toll-free technical phone support, which you should not need. If you’re looking for a scanner that gets the job done on a budget, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a great option.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087248/19272" target="_top" id="2087248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087248/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Compact"><a href="#Best-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Best Compact"></a>Best Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >Brother DSmobile DS-940DW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/r7iU27XA5p_GUkL1jUm-3QFxvnU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/brother-dsmobile-ds-940dw-ff2dd0bc3dd64c09801b7a17c2cb8080.jpg" >Brother DSmobile DS-940DW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Brother-Portable-DS-940DW-Duplex-and-Wireless-Compact-Mobile-Document-Scanner/753713050?slfpid=3" >$200 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/brother-ds-940dw-compact-wireless-duplex-mobile-document-scanner-white/6403626.p?skuId=6403626" >$200 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Compact and portable design</li><li>Great speed for single and double-sided documents</li><li>Wi-Fi and USB connection options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No auto document feeder</li><li>Can’t easily process larger items</li></ul><p> Compact and ideal for any location, the Brother DSmobile DS-940DW is only about the size of a roll of plastic wrap to fit anywhere. It lacks an automatic document feeder because of this and any additional trays, which means it’ll fit into a small home office setup.</p><p> While the DSmobile DS-940DW isn’t aimed at large projects, it still has impressive specifications. It can scan up to 16 pages per minute of single and double-sided documents or business cards without breaking a virtual sweat. Wi-Fi and USB are enabled, too, so it’s easy to hook up to all your devices, whether a desktop, laptop, or mobile.</p><p> Look for aging issues with scanning multiple documents into a single PDF, which should have been resolved with the latest software update.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><h2 id="Best-Wireless"><a href="#Best-Wireless" class="headerlink" title="Best Wireless"></a>Best Wireless</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >Brother ADS-2700W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dNpLawzPVownLkwtcFXMkEqgBtE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/brother-ads-2700w-922ee9ffb2874c8e82706f0bd256703f.jpg" >Brother ADS-2700W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >$348 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast scan speed and accuracy</li><li>50-page automatic feeder</li><li>Security features to protect scanned documents</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Touchscreen is only 3 inches</li><li>OCR isn’t functional when scanning to mobile devices</li></ul><p> The convenience of the Brother ADS-2700W is obvious. With extensive wireless capabilities, staying untethered with this scanner is helpful, although it also has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ethernet-3426740" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capability. Scanning is easy and efficient. Scanning to cloud storage, USB, email, a mobile device, and several other places is effortless.</p><p> The scanner’s image optimization features can automatically delete blank pages, enhance colors, and remove unnecessary backgrounds. It’ll scan with the assistance of a 50-page auto feeder. Security features include<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tls-vs-ssl-4156306" >SSL and TLS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a secure file transfer protocol, and a settings lock for those worried about scanning confidential documents.</p><p> The only real downside here is the touchscreen is pretty tiny, at just under 3 inches. That makes navigating difficult for some people, plus OCR isn’t functional when scanning to a mobile device. Despite that, the ADS-2700W is very practical and worth checking out.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : Yes |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-which-one-should-you-use-4684496" >Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Small-Documents"><a href="#Best-for-Small-Documents" class="headerlink" title="Best for Small Documents"></a>Best for Small Documents</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >Ambir DP667 Card Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wDkY6sAZgF9BT0f0IqoxojgomXQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ambir-dp667-card-scanner-b5d3428fe7f74ecca95bc960392b91b9.jpg" >Ambir DP667 Card Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Staples</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >$160 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.staples.com/ambir-docketport-dp667-portable-card-scanner-black/product%5F1683094" >$212 at Staples <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/689653/DocketPORT-DP667-Card-Scanner-48-bit/?slfpid=3" >$180 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lightweight and portable</li><li>Designed to quickly scan cards and small documents</li><li>Can convert into PDF file</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Can only scan small items</li><li>Not the fastest at scanning</li></ul><p> If you need a scanner for small documents like business cards or pictures, the Ambir DP667 Card Scanner is perfect. It’s USB-powered and easy to use from pretty much anywhere.</p><p> It can scan business cards or documents measuring up to 4x10 inches, maintaining an impressive 600 dpi resolution.

The downside here is the DP667 Card Scanner isn’t the fastest scanner on the market. You’ll need patience when scanning business cards, licenses, or receipts, but it’s easy to use.</p><p> Whether you’re keeping up with your networking at a conference or processing ID cards at a hotel desk, the DP667 Card Scanner has you covered. It’s as simple as it is effective.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/clOpEGj1THt62w2x85i8S4728V0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1400_04-727ac7e2ff18426ba2c23a3212ff067e.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1400"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-When-Buying-Photo-and-Document-Scanners"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-When-Buying-Photo-and-Document-Scanners" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For When Buying Photo and Document Scanners"></a>What to Look For When Buying Photo and Document Scanners</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137220/26400" target="_top" id="2137220">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137220" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137220/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Media-Type"><a href="#Media-Type" class="headerlink" title="Media Type"></a>Media Type</h3><p> How are you planning to use it? A portable scanner might be your best option if you only scan business cards. Alternatively, if you’re looking to scan family heirlooms, you want a model that captures high-quality photos rather than focuses on OCR conversion. For an office environment, being able to scan text well is critical. Depending on your budget, higher-end units are great at everything you throw at them. They can include adjustable sliders, separate bays, and features that simplify the results.</p><h3 id="Scan-Speed"><a href="#Scan-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Scan Speed"></a>Scan Speed</h3><p> If you’re often short on time, impatient, or have many items to scan, you want a scanner that can keep up with you. Look at how many pages a scanner can handle per minute. Also, consider scanners with automatic document feeders if you scan many documents simultaneously. It’ll save you time and effort. However, if you only do it occasionally, you may be better off spending less or focusing on something with more features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/k1E2cV-iUFP2DRxqA5Cv59wqUW0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1600_04-35e5256d360d467a9825ad999e23f8b8.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1600"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><h3 id="Cloud-Support"><a href="#Cloud-Support" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Support"></a>Cloud Support</h3><p> Do you want to be able to access your scanned documents from anywhere?

However, if you’re tight on space or want to take a document scanner with you wherever you go, look for one that’s small and lightweight. A bulky solution will only slow you down and is best suited for a permanent home in your office.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What should you prioritize when buying a document scanner?<br> Every scanner is flawed, so weighing what you need most is crucial. If you need to scan documents occasionally rather than daily, the scanning speed may be less critical. In all cases, though, it’s good to look for an accurate scanner so that the results look perfect every time. An automatic document feeder is often helpful, but it’s optional if you need to scan only a few documents at a time. A better option would be to pick a scanner with suitable software to help you out.</li><li>Are different connectivity types essential?<br> Depending on how you plan to use your document scanner, having different connectivity options at your disposal can be helpful. Many scanners offer Wi-Fi support, which is useful if you plan on scanning to a mobile device or don’t want to be tied down by cables. However, Wi-Fi support is optional if you have a correctly wired home office setup.</li><li>Which is the most common type of scanner?<br> A flatbed scanner is the most common type; inserting documents is generally much more accessible. Some require you to feed the paper manually, making it tricky to do so without damaging the physical item. Look for the most convenient method for your plans. A removable lid can be helpful if you plan on scanning large documents such as books.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-effortless-techniques-crafting-youtube-shorts-images-on-the-fly-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Effortless Techniques Crafting YouTube Shorts Images on the Fly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/1725286759467-iphone/"><u>最卓越的图像传输应用: 无间地连接iPhone与计算机</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/erase-system-misses-message-on-windows-os/"><u>Erase System Misses Message on Windows OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/explore-the-premier-pc-sound-solutions-for-gamers-and-producers-2024-edition/"><u>Explore the Premier PC Sound Solutions for Gamers and Producers - 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/exploring-affordable-ssl-certificate-brands/"><u>Exploring Affordable SSL Certificate Brands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/free-form-funny-meme-tools-on-a-shoestring-budget/"><u>Free-Form Funny Meme Tools on a Shoestring Budget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/from-pure-to-perfected-enhancing-photo-dynamics-with-illustrator-techniques-for-2024/"><u>From Pure to Perfected Enhancing Photo Dynamics with Illustrator Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-all-about-facetune-in-depth-user-guide-and-analysis/"><u>In 2024, All About Facetune In-Depth User Guide & Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-infinix-zero-5g-2023-turbo-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo Like A Pro 5 Easy Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/linksys-ac1900-max-stream-wifi-router-a-versatile-solution-for-every-home-network/"><u>Linksys AC1900 Max-Stream WiFi Router - A Versatile Solution For Every Home Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/navigating-offworlds-cutthroat-market-tips-for-constructing-a-thriving-economic-powerhouse/"><u>Navigating Offworld's Cutthroat Market: Tips for Constructing a Thriving Economic Powerhouse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/review-the-sleek-and-functional-lg-stylo-6-phone-experience/"><u>Review: The Sleek and Functional LG Stylo 6 Phone Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-new-apple-iphone-15-pro-insider-hands-on-analysis/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to the New Apple iPhone 15 Pro: Insider Hands-On Analysis</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The CB3-532 Chromebook 15 from Acer is by no means a flashy laptop, but that’s likely a positive attribute if you’re in the market for a solid Chromebook. With a price that comes in well under $200, and the processor isn’t going to provide any record-breaking speeds. What you do get is a perfectly functional machine for basic productivity, full web-browsing, media consumption, and even some light gaming.</p><p> You’re also getting a massive display that actually impressed us in our tests, especially when compared to other laptops in this range. I spent a few days of regular use with this Chromebook and broke down what it does well and what corners it has to cut to meet this price point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KPrvN1kvoH081BHRUonphp9CIeY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer_LaptopsUnder200_Chromebook_02-c3813ec58fc848e6a715abe090ebe6b1.jpg"                      alt="Acer Chromebook 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jason Schneider</p><h2 id="Design-Slightly-bulky-with-a-couple-of-nice-touches"><a href="#Design-Slightly-bulky-with-a-couple-of-nice-touches" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slightly bulky with a couple of nice touches"></a><strong>Design: Slightly bulky with a couple of nice touches</strong></h2><p> The first thing you’ll notice about this laptop is just how large it is. That’s mostly to be expected, because it does sport a 15.6-inch display, meaning the chassis has to be at least that big. But the large, approximately 1-inch bezels around the screen make it pretty large, even considering the expected footprint.</p><p> The color scheme feels very modern, looking very similar to Apple’s space gray. There’s a soft brushed-aluminum-style texture on the top, and a dark, roughened plastic base and inner bezels. There are also two large, round-rectangle speaker grilles flanking the speakers that give it a more assertive look than the usual, simple aesthetic used by other laptops.</p><p> The hinge is actually two small contact points that roll into the laptop chassis, which feels dated when the laptop is open but makes it look interesting when it’s closed. The whole laptop is made of plastic, and measures right around one 1-inch thick, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds. That’s a double-edged sword because while the laptop feels really sturdy and premium despite the plastic material, it isn’t terribly portable.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-As-seamless-as-a-mobile-device"><a href="#Setup-Process-As-seamless-as-a-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: As seamless as a mobile device"></a><strong>Setup Process: As seamless as a mobile device</strong></h2><p> One added benefit to opting for a Chromebook instead of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >full PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that the software is really light. This has implications for both productivity and performance, but it provides a big benefit for the setup process. Because the entire experience, from bootup to browsing, has been designed by Google, you can expect a very similar look and feel to what you’ve probably experienced when signing up and signing in to a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-gmail-1172005" >Gmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or YouTube account.</p><p> The device first asks you to set your regions, then connect to a Wi-Fi network, then finally to sign into a Google account and set up permissions. From here it drops you basically immediately to the Chromebook home screen where you can either dive right in, or follow the popup tour given by Google. One thing I liked a lot about this was that Google gives you a short three-popup tour to start, then asks if you’d like to go deeper or just jump right into the machine yourself. This staged version of a device tour is a great way to let you, the user, tailor it to your preferences. This also makes it great for an older-aged tech user who might need a bit of hand-holding as they get to know their laptop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886003/19272" target="_top" id="1886003">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886003" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886003/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Big-bright-and-better-than-you-might-think"><a href="#Display-Big-bright-and-better-than-you-might-think" class="headerlink" title="Display: Big, bright, and better than you might think"></a><strong>Display: Big, bright, and better than you might think</strong></h2><p> The display on the Acer Chromebook 15 is bigger than you might expect from a laptop that runs<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-chrome-os-1616448" >Chrome OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with a 15.6-inch backlit LED screen that offers a ton of room for windows and programs. The resolution measures in at 1366x768 meaning it checks all the boxes for being classified as an HD display.</p><p> What surprised me was just how good this screen looks for a budget panel. Most screens at this level will give you just enough pixels to advertise themselves as HD, but will skimp on viewing angles and color representation. But, the screen offers plenty of brightness, and if you turn the blue temperature down a bit (do this in the “night light” part of the Settings section, but turn it on all the time, not just during bedtime), the screen looks really decent.</p><p> The whole laptop is made of plastic, and measures right around 1-inch thick, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds.</p><h2 id="Performance-Really-solid-to-a-point"><a href="#Performance-Really-solid-to-a-point" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Really solid, to a point"></a><strong>Performance: Really solid, to a point</strong></h2><p> Chrome OS provides an interesting advantage in the performance category. Right out of the box, this laptop will look and feel very fast, but as soon as you try to open more than about 6 tabs on Chrome, or you fire up multiple apps and videos, it slows down exponentially. On paper, it sports a dual-core Intel Celeron N3060 processor capable for standard-run speeds of 1.6GHz.</p><p> The configuration I chose also includes 4GB of LPDDR3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159" >RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and 16GB of eMMC memory. These last two points help to make up for the somewhat limited processor by giving decent short-term storage needs and a reasonably fast flash-style memory. But, because the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddr3-vs-ddr4-which-ram-is-best-4779993" >DDR3 RAM is a bit dated <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and caps out at 4GB, you’ll find that it gets a little sluggish when you push it. It’s also unfortunate to see merely 16GB of storage, severely limiting the amount of movies, photos, and files you can fit on the device.</p><p> To be fair, Chromebook users likely keep more files in cloud storage drives, and Google includes 100GB of drive storage for free with the purchase for 2 years. So, you might not notice the limited capacity, but I would have preferred at least 32GB.</p><h2 id="Productivity-and-Component-Quality-Plenty-of-screen-real-estate-and-passable-features"><a href="#Productivity-and-Component-Quality-Plenty-of-screen-real-estate-and-passable-features" class="headerlink" title="Productivity and Component Quality: Plenty of screen real estate, and passable features"></a><strong>Productivity and Component Quality: Plenty of screen real estate, and passable features</strong></h2><p> There’s an interesting case to be made for this Acer Chromebook in terms of productivity. Chrome OS is a very light operating system, which means that it runs quick and light, at least initially. This also means that you can load up more than a few Chrome tabs—something that hogs a lot of power use on Windows laptops. Add that in with the larger 15.6-inch display, giving you lots of room for multiple windows and apps, and this Chromebook is great for those who want to multitask. However, because it isn’t a full OS, you won’t be able to run a whole lot of programs out of the box, and you’re limited to what’s available in the Play Store.</p><p> The fit and finish of this laptop also contributes to its productivity capabilities. The full-sized keyboard is actually pretty passable, which is surprising for such a budget device. Because the chassis is thicker, Acer has been able to put in a bit more key travel than you might expect, and even though the action of the keyboard feels just a bit mushy, I found the keyboard pretty great to use.</p><p> I am a little annoyed with the “search” key that Chromebooks placed where a caps lock key should be–resulting in a lot of accidental search callups. The trackpad also leaves a bit to be desired, requiring a firm, chunky press, and doesn’t support as many gestures as Windows or OSX.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-An-unexpected-letdown"><a href="#Audio-An-unexpected-letdown" class="headerlink" title="Audio: An unexpected letdown"></a><strong>Audio: An unexpected letdown</strong></h2><p> Laptops are never amazing specimen when it comes to on-board speakers, so I wasn’t expecting much out of this either. Because it’s a 15-inch machine, there’s plenty of room in the Chromebook 15 for more components, and Acer has opted to put in two giant speaker grilles along either side of the keyboard. Taking that into account, I was hoping that the speakers would be louder and fuller than a normal laptop. However, the response is very tinny and it wasn’t as loud as I was hoping. In fact, these are among the worst speakers I’ve tested on a budget laptop, leaving me to believe that the grilles are just for show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yw3n6Y9SGTIh4h10bF7XbAc5La0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer_LaptopsUnder200_Chromebook_03-5724a73204e94f548f20aec5fa86074f.jpg"                      alt="Acer Chromebook 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jason Schneider</p><h2 id="Network-and-connectivity-Modern-fast-and-optimized-for-Chrome-OS"><a href="#Network-and-connectivity-Modern-fast-and-optimized-for-Chrome-OS" class="headerlink" title="Network and connectivity: Modern, fast, and optimized for Chrome OS"></a><strong>Network and connectivity: Modern, fast, and optimized for Chrome OS</strong></h2><p> Despite the lighter OS, the Chromebook 15 offers modern, well-equipped network features. First off, there’s an 802.11ac-capable Wi-Fi card built-in, which means you’ll get less interference than the N-protocol Wi-Fi, and you’ll have access to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-5-ghz-wifi-better-than-2-4-ghz-818293" >5GHz bands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> common in most modern routers. There’s also Bluetooth 4.2 capability which provided me with a plenty-stable connection for my Bluetooth headphones, and will work nicely if you want to connect a mouse or other peripherals.</p><p> As far as ports go, there are the requisite AC power and 3.5mm headphone input ports, plus a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI output <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for connecting an external monitor. There are also two USB 3.0 ports—one on each side—for increased data transfer speeds. I would have liked to see at least one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as the mobile industry is heading decidedly in that direction, but it isn’t the end of the world. There’s also a full-sized SD card slot to help expand the storage of the device, which is important considering how little space is available on the device itself. Overall, this thing checks most of the boxes, though with the large chassis it would have been nice to have seen just a few more I&#x2F;O options.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006933/19272" target="_top" id="2006933">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006933" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006933/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Grainy-but-passable"><a href="#Camera-Grainy-but-passable" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Grainy, but passable"></a><strong>Camera: Grainy, but passable</strong></h2><p> Most laptops I’ve tested at any price point sport a borderline abysmal webcam, so my expectations are never high for low-end laptops like this one. However, even though the pictures and videos recorded are noticeable grainy, the color response was pretty good.</p><p> This is likely because Google is calling this an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -capable webcam, meaning the software is increasing the ISO to give you clear performance. This gives you good color response as I’ve noted, but it does also result in that graininess. This shouldn’t be a breaking point in either direction for considering a laptop like this, but if you do a lot of video calls, it’s an important thing to consider.</p><h2 id="Battery-life-Very-reliable-with-smart-optimization"><a href="#Battery-life-Very-reliable-with-smart-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Battery life: Very reliable with smart optimization"></a><strong>Battery life: Very reliable with smart optimization</strong></h2><p> As a light OS, it wasn’t that surprising to see excellent battery life on the Chromebook 15, but I was pleased with just how long the battery lasted. There’s a 3,920mAh lithium-polymer battery that Acer pins at about 12 hours of use. That holds true, perhaps trending toward a little less.</p><p> That’s an impressive performance for a display this large, as there are a lot of pixels to push, but is likely a result of Chrome OS’s light running load and display brightness optimization. The battery also recharges very quickly, allowing for you to quickly add some extra juice to a dying laptop in a pinch. All in all, this is definitely a pro for this device, making it a reliable travel machine.</p><p> Chrome OS is a very light operating system, which means that it runs quick and light, at least initially.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115932/19272" target="_top" id="2115932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Light-and-fast-with-very-little-customization"><a href="#Software-Light-and-fast-with-very-little-customization" class="headerlink" title="Software: Light and fast with very little customization"></a><strong>Software: Light and fast with very little customization</strong></h2><p> Using Chrome OS is more reliable than you might think. You have most of the functions you’ll need from Google Docs to web browsing to file storage. However, you’ll be missing a lot of more specialized programs, like the full Adobe Creative Suite, or PC-based media programs. Due to the low-powered processor and limited shared Graphics capability, you wouldn’t be able to use this laptop for video editing anyway, even if it did run Windows. So, even though it’s limiting, it’s on purpose.</p><p> That said, the Chromebook 15 runs so well, though likely only because of the lightweight operating system and limited app capabilities. Chrome OS is kind of like just using a Chrome window with a bunch of tabs on a regular PC. For most people, the OS is more than capable of handling most of your browsing needs. This Chromebook is a great example of how far you can push Chrome OS on a budget device, with a big bright screen for watching movies, too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Really-affordable-with-plenty-to-offer"><a href="#Price-Really-affordable-with-plenty-to-offer" class="headerlink" title="Price: Really affordable with plenty to offer"></a><strong>Price: Really affordable with plenty to offer</strong></h2><p> The list price for this Acer Chromebook sits at just about $400 (MSRP), but most of the time you can find it on Amazon for between $150-$250. I picked up my unit for about $185, and it tends to hover just around there.</p><p> For the money, I can confidently say this laptop is worth the price, as long as you have the right applications in mind for it. If you want a cheap starter laptop, or a machine for an older family member that’s easy to use, but you don’t want to spend half a grand getting there, this is a great choice. I can’t say it’s quite as travel-friendly as some of the other budget laptops out there, due to the size and weight. But if you want an affordable machine that’s great for light productivity tasks, and is an excellent movie machine, then you should consider this.</p><h2 id="Acer-Chromebook-15-vs-Lenovo-Chromebook-S330-14"><a href="#Acer-Chromebook-15-vs-Lenovo-Chromebook-S330-14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Chromebook 15 vs. Lenovo Chromebook S330 14"></a><strong>Acer Chromebook 15 vs. Lenovo Chromebook S330 14</strong></h2><p> Lenovo’s entry into the large, budget Chromebook range brings a few different features into play. The most notable difference is the build—you’ll get a thinner, sleeker laptop with the Lenovo, including a much more premium-looking and -feeling keyboard, plus 64GB of storage and a lighter weight. However, you’ll sacrifice the Intel processor (the Lenovo sports a more dated chip from MediaTek) and the battery life isn’t quite as good. That package comes in at a little higher on the price scale, too.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A solid Chromebook for productivity, but limited in portability.</strong></p><p> This is a great Chromebook with a lot of impressive things to offer. The bright screen has plenty of room for vibrant video viewing and multiple windows of productivity. The excellent battery life means you won’t be tethered to a desk, and the light, fast Chrome OS means it will take a lot to slow the Acer Chromebook 15 down. However, the limited onboard storage, bulky size and weight, and the lack of full app choices might limit you a bit too much. At the end of the day, at this price point, it’s perfect for light, basic use.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Chromebook 15 CB3-532</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>Price  $185.00</li><li>Release Date  July 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  15.1 x 10.1 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Processor  Intel Celeron N3060, 1.6 GHz</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  16GB</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-ace-the-art-of-shooting-on-a-green-screen/"><u>[New] Ace the Art of Shooting on a Green Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-creating-compelling-hauls-techniques-for-an-engaging-viewing-experience/"><u>[New] Creating Compelling Hauls Techniques for an Engaging Viewing Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-saving-movies-effortlessly-pc-mac-and-iosandroid/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Saving Movies Effortlessly PC, Mac & iOS/Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-lenovo-chromebook-duet-comprehensive-review-of-the-versatile-2-in-1-device/"><u>Budget-Friendly Lenovo Chromebook Duet - Comprehensive Review of the Versatile 2-in-1 Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-choosing-a-great-phone-the-oneplus-nord-n10-5g-highlighted/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Choosing a Great Phone: The OnePlus Nord N10 5G Highlighted</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/full-guide-to-hard-reset-your-oppo-reno-8t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Full Guide to Hard Reset Your Oppo Reno 8T 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/leveraging-instagrams-music-icon-feature-effectively/"><u>Leveraging Instagram’s Music Icon Feature Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/simplified-review-tp-link-re305-ac1200-wi-fi-signal-booster-assessment/"><u>Simplified Review: TP-Link RE305 AC1200 Wi-Fi Signal Booster Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/stepwise-integration-merging-hp-officejet-8720-with-pcs/"><u>Stepwise Integration: Merging HP Officejet 8720 with PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-pelvis-is-a-common-site-for-osteolytic-lesions-because-of-its-high-red-marrow-content-and-blood-supply/"><u>The Pelvis Is a Common Site for Osteolytic Lesions because of Its High Red Marrow Content and Blood Supply</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/travellers-choice-best-portable-online-signal-devices/"><u>Travellers' Choice: Best Portable Online Signal Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/ultimate-selection-elite-iphone-call-alerts-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Selection Elite iPhone Call Alerts for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The watch lets kids communicate with parents and other caregivers via SMS and voice calls, has live GPS tracking via the NickWatch app, and has a ton of activities and games with Nickelodeon characters like SpongeBob and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The company promises regular content updates, too, which could help your kiddo avoid boredom with seeing the same stuff over and over.</p><p> “NickWatch is a true disruptor in the wearable tech category for kids, combining world-class Nickelodeon content with unrivaled parental controls and features,” said Udi Miron, CEO at Watchinu,<a class="link"   href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/watchinu-brings-award-winning-nickelodeon-smartwatch-for-kids-to-the-us-302195353.html" >in a statement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . “We are bringing to market a smartwatch that is not only fun and enriching, but will grow with the children who wear them for years to come.”</p><p> The idea is to empower your kids’ independence while keeping them safe, of course, and the NickWatch app offers a subscription ($8 - $13 per month) to do just that with location tracking and communication tools. You can also create an area you want your kids to stay in (a geofence) and get a notification if they go past those boundaries. Parents and caregivers can even mute the watch during school hours and manage who can chat with their kiddo on the watch.</p><p> The NickWatch will retail or $119. It will be available at Walmart.com Saturday, July 13, and should appear in Walmart stores starting in October.  </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/nickWatch-by-nickelodeon/6344272802" >$119 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-smartwatch-8666142" >5 Things to Consider Before You Buy a Smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-overcoming-the-windows-11-photo-app-hurdles/"><u>[New] Overcoming the Windows 11 Photo App Hurdles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-melodies-of-the-night-king-recommended-sites-for-tts-downloads/"><u>2024 Approved Melodies of the Night King Recommended Sites for TTS Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/creating-characters-crafting-chronicles-gpts-sixfold-strategy/"><u>Creating Characters, Crafting Chronicles: GPT's Sixfold Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-s-top-rated-free-video-editors-for-32-bit-windows-users/"><u>New In 2024, S Top-Rated Free Video Editors for 32-Bit Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/pioneering-hardware-analysis-on-tomtechchannel/"><u>Pioneering Hardware Analysis on TomTechChannel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/qual-e-melhor-em-termos-de-qualidade-imagem-png-versus-imagem-jpg-um-confronto-direto/"><u>Qual É Melhor Em Termos De Qualidade: Imagem PNG versus Imagem JPG – Um Confronto Direto.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/streamlining-your-way-through-fax-cover-customization-in-win11/"><u>Streamlining Your Way Through Fax Cover Customization in Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-6-indicators-its-time-to-upgrade-transitioning-from-mobile-games-to-cutting-edge-portable-consoles/"><u>Top 6 Indicators It's Time to Upgrade: Transitioning From Mobile Games to Cutting-Edge Portable Consoles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/transform-your-windows-handheld-device-into-a-steam-deck-with-these-simple-steps/"><u>Transform Your Window's Handheld Device Into a Steam Deck with These Simple Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/ultimate-control-of-apple-tv-remotes-steps-for-connection-management-and-factory-restore/"><u>Ultimate Control of Apple TV Remotes: Steps for Connection Management & Factory Restore</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unlock-innovative-gaming-sessions-with-geforce-nows-one-day-playtime-passes/"><u>Unlock Innovative Gaming Sessions with GeForce NOW's One-Day Playtime Passes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unlock-the-full-potential-of-your-new-steam-deck-with-top-rated-strategies/"><u>Unlock the Full Potential of Your New Steam Deck with Top-Rated Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unlocking-ultra-hd-the-truth-about-capturing-4k-signals-from-your-antenna-today/"><u>Unlocking Ultra HD: The Truth About Capturing 4K Signals From Your Antenna Today.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/unraveling-youtubes-viewer-metrics-a-deeper-look-for-2024/"><u>Unraveling YouTube's Viewer Metrics A Deeper Look for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983588">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983588">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"                      style="border: none;

Most cameras aren’t completely waterproof, and while many can handle some rain during outdoor shoots, the options are limited for cameras that you can take on underwater shoots. Of course, not all waterproof cameras are created equal, either. While some are ideal for shooting marine life documentaries, others are designed for the frantic action of water sports.</p><p> Levels of waterproofing differ as well. Depending on their <a class="link"   href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/" >water resistance rating <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, some cameras can work in wet conditions, while others can be taken for long underwater shoots and down to impressive depths. If you’re looking for an underwater camera, consider the duration and depth of the dive. You’ll want to invest in underwater cameras that can last for the entirety of a dive, exploration, or shoot. Battery life is an important consideration here, too—water resistance won’t matter so much if your camera battery dies mid-shoot.</p><p> On the other hand, while action cameras for recording water-based sports require high levels of water resistance, their photo and video capture speeds and quality are more essential factors. Also, if you plan to dive deep and capture video, you’ll need a hi-res waterproof camera with sufficient storage for sharp images and improved low-light performance for clear visibility. You may also want a waterproof camera that supports wide-angle and macrophotography to capture different perspectives. Additionally, ensure that the camera is leak-proof, shockproof, and freezeproof.</p><p> Of course, most shopping decisions come down to the price. Waterproof cameras can be pricey, but we’ve included a selection across the price spectrum to meet every budget.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts who have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

An improvement on the already impressive Olympus Tough TG-5, it starts up in less than 2 seconds, comes with a user-friendly interface, and has an all-around solid build.</p><p> This Olympus camera features a 12MP lens, an F2.0 aperture, and a back-illuminated CMOS sensor with an anti-reflective coating for improved lighting. While it shoots decent pictures during the day comparable to smartphones, it excels at low-light cinematography, even at 50ft underwater.</p><p> It comes with a 3-inch LCD screen with 1.04 million dots for improved display resolution and can reach up to 8x zoom with manual focus support. The TG-6 is also great for taking close-up 1 cm macrophotography shots. The camera has four macro shooting modes, allowing you to capture smaller objects in much greater detail than most of the competition, up to 44x zoom.</p><p> Of course, the Tough TG-6 has plenty of features for underwater photos. Olympius has packed in five underwater shooting modes and three white balance modes. It can record 4K video and 120fps high-speed movies for water sports, so the action won’t be blurry.</p><p> Finally, the TG-6 supports RAW photos and has a battery life of about two hours, so you’ll be able to get all the footage you need in the format you need it in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/olympus-tough-tg-6-camera-pfp.png"                      alt="Olympus Tough TG-6 Camera pfp on transparent background"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Waterproof Camera Overall</p><h5 id="Olympus-Tough-TG-6-Waterproof-Camera-1"><a href="#Olympus-Tough-TG-6-Waterproof-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="Olympus Tough TG-6 Waterproof Camera"></a>Olympus Tough TG-6 Waterproof Camera</h5><p>The Olympus Tough TG-6 Camera is one of the best waterproof cameras you’ll find.

Regarding docking stations, you might be tempted to dive right in with first-party offerings, such as the <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >Valve Steam Deck Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or the <a class="link"

While these are both undoubtedly excellent options, they’re not exactly the most cost-effective, and depending on what you’re looking to gain from your docking station, you may find they are lacking in certain areas.</p><p> For instance, if you’re simply looking to connect your handheld to a big-screen TV or gaming monitor, you may not need an abundance of USB ports on your dock. However, if you want to repurpose your Steam Deck or ROG Ally into a gaming PC, you will want a docking station that can accommodate peripherals, such as a mouse and keyboard, for extra versatility.</p><p> Selecting a dock that can support 100W power delivery will benefit a more full-fat setup, as you’ll be able to provide power to all your add-on devices without diminishing your overall gaming experience. You might want to consider a docking station with more premium features, such as an M.2 SSD slot, which will give you acres of convenient storage space to play with.</p><p> Features such as Ethernet ports will provide a more stable connection for online play, while a hub with DisplayPort capabilities will allow you to set up multiple displays simultaneously. Whatever kind of docking station you’re looking for, we’ve got the lowdown right here to help you choose the best option for your handheld PC.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts who have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It has six ports, including HDMI 2.0 (supporting 4K output at 60Hz), Gigabit Ethernet, one USB-C port, plus two USB-A ports for peripheral devices. And if that’s not enough to wet your whistle, it also has an M.2 slot for SSD storage.</p><p> Incorporating built-in NVMe SSD support into the design of this docking station is, frankly, a stroke of genius. Simply docking it gives you up to 4TBs of expandable storage for your console. It also eliminates the need to constantly cycle through your library of downloaded games, swapping them out and deleting them to make room for your current faves.</p><p> The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station also supports 100W power delivery, so there’s enough juice to power your Steam Deck at full charging speed. It also offers data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, so you can enjoy a fast and reliable gaming experience with this powerful hub, especially when using a Gigabit Ethernet connection.</p><p> With a price tag just shy of $90, the JSAUX M.2 Docking Station won’t be for everyone. However, it has everything you need for a great time with your Steam Deck, and the bonus of SSD storage support makes it more akin to using a conventional desktop PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/jsaux-m-2-docking-station-tag.png"                      alt="JSAUX M.2 Docking Station TAG"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Steam Deck Dock Overall</p><h5 id="JSAUX-M-2-Docking-Station-1"><a href="#JSAUX-M-2-Docking-Station-1" class="headerlink" title="JSAUX M.2 Docking Station"></a>JSAUX M.2 Docking Station</h5><p>The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station is ideal for leveling up your Steam Deck gameplay, with its integrated M.2 SSD slot, super-fast data transfer speeds, and plenty of ports for connecting your gaming peripherals.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Compatible-Ethernet-Ports-HB0604-Included/dp/B0BNTQWKN6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$90 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="The-Official-Steam-Deck-Dock-Steam-Deck-Docking-Station"><a href="#The-Official-Steam-Deck-Dock-Steam-Deck-Docking-Station" class="headerlink" title="The Official Steam Deck Dock: Steam Deck Docking Station"></a>The Official Steam Deck Dock: <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >Steam Deck Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/valvew-steam-deck-dock.png"                      alt="Valve Steam Deck Dock"                > </p><p>Valve</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Firmare updates vis SteamOS</td><td>✗ Expensive</td></tr><tr><td>✓ FreeSync VRR support</td><td>✗ Not compatible with the ASUS ROG Ally</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Includes power adapter</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you might expect, Valve’s official <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" >Steam Deck Docking Station <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is tailor-made for Steam Deck owners. It offers a seamless experience for the Steam Deck, supporting a dual-display setup (up to 4K at 60Hz or 1440p at 120Hz), firmware updates, and even its own power adapter.</p><p> It comes equipped with at least three USB-A 3.1 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0, though sadly, no USB-C port is included here. It provides multi-monitor support, FreeSync VRR support for external monitors, and firmware updates via SteamOS.</p><p> This first-party docking station is the perfect match for your Steam Deck, boasting an impressive build quality and a feature-rich design. Made from the same materials as the Steam Deck, it acts as a natural extension of your handheld in terms of its look and functionality.</p><p> On the downside, which is no great surprise, the Steam Deck Docking Station isn’t compatible with the ASUS ROG Ally.

This 65W charger dock allows simultaneous PD3.0 fast charging while providing display output at up to 4K at 60Hz via its HDMI 2.0 port.</p><p> It features a USB-C port and USB-A port and can charge two devices simultaneously, using 60W and 5W of charging power for the USB-C and USB-A ports, respectively.</p><p> Compact and convenient, the ROG Gaming Charger Dock has a high portability factor and can easily be stowed away inside a bag or backpack.

Nevertheless, it’s compatible with the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally, offers six ports (including three USB-A and two USB-C), supports 4K resolution (with a 60Hz refresh rate), and costs less than $30.</p><p> With three USB-A ports, this dock is ideal for hooking up additional devices, such as a mouse and keyboard, to turn your handheld into a mini gaming desktop. The Type-C ports (something that the official Valve option lacks) can be used for power delivery or external storage, while the HDMI port allows you to use a secondary display, such as a TV or monitor.</p><p> It’s versatile enough to be compatible with other USB-C devices and provides a sturdy non-slip base on which it can be placed. It also supports PD 3.0 with up to 95W charging speeds, meaning that your device can be charged quickly while docked.</p><p> The Sabrent 6-Port Docking Station will appeal to anyone who loves the look of the Valve Steam Deck Docking Station but doesn’t want to pay the premium asking price for the official model. And while it lacks the bells and whistles of the Valve Dock, it still represents excellent value for money, with enough features to satisfy many Steam Deck (or ROG Ally) fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sabrent-6-port-docking-station-tag.png"                      alt="SABRENT 6-Port Docking Station TAG"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Budget Dock</p><h5 id="SABRENT-6-Port-Docking-Station-1"><a href="#SABRENT-6-Port-Docking-Station-1" class="headerlink" title="SABRENT 6-Port Docking Station"></a>SABRENT 6-Port Docking Station</h5><p>$28 $30 Save $2 </p><p>Compatible with both the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally, the Sabrent 6-Port Docking Station is one of the best multi-purpose hubs available at a more budget-friendly price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Docking-Station-Devices-DS-SD6P/dp/B0BTJYY8MD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$28 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Compact-Dock-Syntech-Mini-Dock"><a href="#Best-Compact-Dock-Syntech-Mini-Dock" class="headerlink" title="Best Compact Dock: Syntech Mini Dock"></a>Best Compact Dock: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Compatible-Accessories-Ethernet-Stability/dp/B0BP24YDP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Syntech Mini Dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/syntech-mini-dock.png"                      alt="Syntech Mini Dock"                > </p><p>Syntech</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Compact, space-saving design</td><td>✗ Port placement isn’t ideal</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Reasonable price point</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ Compatible with both Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Compatible-Accessories-Ethernet-Stability/dp/B0BP24YDP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Syntech Mini Dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> scores high in the portability stakes.

It packs neatly into any bag or backpack and makes docking your ROG ally or Steam Deck a cinch when you’re on the move.</p><p> The Syntech Mini Dock has been designed with a rounded base, providing good stability when docking your handheld. Thanks to its sturdier foundation, you don’t need to worry about your console tipping over, despite this dock’s smaller size. It has six ports, including an HDMI 2.0 port (which supports up to 4K at 60Hz), three USB-A ports for external devices, Gigabit Ethernet, and USB-C. </p><p> The docking station features anti-slip grips inside the console cradle so that your device holds its position, and a gripped pad on the bottom of the dock keeps it firmly rooted to your table or desk. As another handy quality-of-life feature, it can accommodate most protective cases, so you won’t need to remove these before docking your device.</p><p> The Syntech Mini Dock is ideal for anyone who likes to travel on their Steam Deck or ROG Ally and is looking for a stable and effective space-saving dock that won’t break the bank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/syntech-mini-dock-tag.png"                      alt="Syntech Mini Dock TAG"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136616/26400" target="_top" id="2136616">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136616" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136616/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Compact Dock</p><h5 id="Syntech-Mini-Dock-1"><a href="#Syntech-Mini-Dock-1" class="headerlink" title="Syntech Mini Dock"></a>Syntech Mini Dock</h5><p>Thanks to its space-saving circular design, the Syntech Mini Dock is one of the best options available for gaming on the go with your Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Compatible-Accessories-Ethernet-Stability/dp/B0BP24YDP1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003914&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-steam-deck-docks/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$39 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="How-do-I-connect-my-Steam-Deck-or-ROG-Ally-to-a-TV"><a href="#How-do-I-connect-my-Steam-Deck-or-ROG-Ally-to-a-TV" class="headerlink" title="How do I connect my Steam Deck or ROG Ally to a TV?"></a>How do I connect my Steam Deck or ROG Ally to a TV?</h3><p> To connect your Steam Deck or ROG Ally to your TV, you’ll need to connect a USB-C hub or USB-C to HDMI cable to your TV (with the HDMI end), with the USB-C end plugged into your console. </p><p> With your TV on, select the corresponding HDMI input option and make sure your Steam Deck or ROG Ally is switched on.

It also has the advantage of running Windows 11 (compared to Steam Deck’s SteamOS, which runs on Linux) which gives you access to other storefronts. </p><p> In contrast, the Steam Deck offers a marginally better battery life, and arguably provides the best tactile experience, with its precision trackpad and more familiar button array. It’s also considerably cheaper than the ROG Ally, which makes it the more accessible of the two. </p><h3 id="Can-I-play-non-Steam-games-on-the-Steam-Deck"><a href="#Can-I-play-non-Steam-games-on-the-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="Can I play non-Steam games on the Steam Deck?"></a>Can I play non-Steam games on the Steam Deck?</h3><p> Yes, you can.

While I’ve built up great cities on earth, there is one place I haven’t been to: outer space. Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087234/19272" target="_top" id="2087234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087234/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying"><a href="#Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Humans have never been so annoying"></a><strong>Performance: Humans have never been so annoying</strong></h2><p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948932/19272" target="_top" id="1948932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms.

What else is new and different about the Echo Dot (4th Gen)? How does the new Dot perform? I tested the Echo Dot (4th Gen) to find out.</p><h2 id="Design-A-completely-new-look"><a href="#Design-A-completely-new-look" class="headerlink" title="Design: A completely new look"></a><strong>Design: A completely new look</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TtbQpfhvpeKgt-Aso1WoKQ6m2VI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-2-89fbd54fb6a14efba195a0094b8d7b6f.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> As time has passed and Amazon has released newer versions of its Echo Dot speaker, the company has shied away from sharp edges and hard plastic shells in favor of softer designs. You may remember the 2nd-gen model had more of a puck-shape, with a hard plastic shell and more defined edges. The earlier Dots looked more like networking equipment than home devices. However, this changed with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-4772274#:~:text=The%20Amazon%20Echo%20Dot%20%283rd,Dot%20is%20a%20great%20buy." >3rd-Gen Dot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which had an airier feel, slightly rounded edges, and a fabric surround. This made the Dot feel more like a speaker made for the home and less like an office product.</p><p> The new Dot (4th Gen) is even softer and rounder, with a spherical shape and fabric covering most of the speaker, including the top portion. The 4th Gen Dot comes in three color options: charcoal, glacier white, and twilight blue. I tested the twilight blue color.</p><p> The new Dot measures 3.94 inches in diameter and 3.54 inches tall. The light ring sits on the bottom and the four main button controls sit on top of the speaker. The raised buttons make the Echo Dot look kind of like a small bowling ball from certain angles, but it’s nice to have the microphone off button right on top of the device for easy access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HELf_jWdoxnVe1w7XOL9sC7GoO8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-4-f100069b4b7d40dc8661b1614e150934.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The 4th Gen Dot still has a 3.5 mm output jack, which I was really pleased to see. Google’s Nest Mini (2nd Gen) lacks a 3.5 mm jack. However, unlike Google’s newest mini smart speaker, the Echo Dot does not have a keyhole mount for mounting on a wall. The speaker is meant for placement on a flat surface, as evidenced by the rubberized bottom that prevents slipping and helps the Echo Dot stay in place.</p><p> Overall, I really appreciate the design of the new Dot. Modern and elegant, it fits into my living room, kitchen, or bedroom, as it doesn’t have a cold feel that takes away from the space. The 4th-Gen Dot is made from environmentally conscious materials like post-consumer recycled plastics and fabrics, thus securing it a “Climate Pledge Friendly” tag on Amazon.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-as-ever"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-as-ever" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy as ever"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy as ever</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-amazon-echo-4153561" >Setting up the Echo Dot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is simple, especially if you already have the Alexa app downloaded. In the Alexa app, you just go to the devices menu, select on the “+” to add a device, and follow the prompts to add the Echo Dot 4th Gen speaker. The process only takes a moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dVUkRuy5SxFHmCHXxSseZY5tjhw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-3-320d298cdb18405d9d326c272464ef0d.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148639/16836" target="_top" id="2148639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148639/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sound-Quality-A-front-firing-speaker"><a href="#Sound-Quality-A-front-firing-speaker" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: A front-firing speaker"></a><strong>Sound Quality: A front-firing speaker</strong></h2><p> The new Echo Dot has good sound, it’s just not all that much better than the Echo Dot (3rd Gen). When testing speakers, I frequently use the song_Titanium_ by David Guetta featuring Sia because it has a range of low, mid, and high tones. For testing bass, I often use the song_Chains_ by Nick Jonas. The Echo Dot (4th Gen) sounds pretty clear on all volume levels. There is a very slight hiss on the highest volume, but it’s barely noticeable, and it doesn’t take too much away from the listening experience.</p><p> With a 1.6-inch front-firing speaker, the Echo Dot (4th Gen) is loud enough to play music throughout a large space. I can hear the music throughout the entire first floor of my home. The Dot doesn’t sound as rich as the regular Echo, but it still sounds good, especially considering its small size (and small price tag). If you want to, you can also connect an external speaker using the 3.5 mm jack or using a Bluetooth connection.</p><p> With a 1.6-inch front-firing speaker, the Echo Dot (4th Gen) is loud enough to play music throughout a large space.</p><p> Voice recognition is so important in smart speakers because they need to be able to hear your voice commands even when there’s background noise. The Echo Dot (4th Gen) has four far-field microphones for voice detection like its predecessor. It does a good job of detecting commands from across the room, even in the presence of household noises like a running dishwasher or light conversation. However, if you have a room full of people loudly talking, you might need to raise your voice slightly to get the mics to hear your commands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UFZM9HpoakK6sRg-7Vm2W8uLIQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-6-with-Clock-86c91da96d4043369f0a4e97b22c4209.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Features-The-same-Alexa"><a href="#Features-The-same-Alexa" class="headerlink" title="Features: The same Alexa"></a><strong>Features: The same Alexa</strong></h2><p> The Echo Dot (4th Gen) is powered by<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

I tested the “with clock” iteration as a part of this review, but I did not test the kids model.</p><p> I was blown away by the Echo Dot (4th Gen) With Clock. It’s the same device (internally) as the regular Echo Dot (4th Gen), but it has an LED display on the front of the speaker. Doesn’t sound like much, right?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bnVMEDjyf8t4zDkpRwr4-5msD2s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-7-with-Clock-9b93a56f3d0049c5a2064cd4b21c7cb5.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> It actually makes a huge difference in the looks of the Dot speaker. The addition of the clock improves the aesthetics big time, making the Dot look less like a speaker and more like a really cool smart clock. Because the Dot is round, it ends up having a large space on the front—almost like a face; it’s a perfect home for the clock display.</p><p> The “with clock” version displays the time, and you can turn the display on or off, as well as adjust the brightness. The clock can also display the temperature or work as a stopwatch. In the previous generation, the clock felt like an afterthought. The clock on the new 4th Gen model feels so intentional—it truly improves the design and makes the “with clock” version a much more desirable model in the Echo lineup.</p><p> I like the Echo Dot (4th Gen) with Clock better than the regular Echo Dot (4th Gen), as the regular version feels like it’s missing something.</p><h2 id="Price-60-with-clock-50-without"><a href="#Price-60-with-clock-50-without" class="headerlink" title="Price: $60 with clock, $50 without"></a><strong>Price: $60 with clock, $50 without</strong></h2><p> The Echo Dot (4th Gen) retails for $50, and for $10 more, you can pick up the “with clock” version. The clock is very much worth it simply because the device looks so much better with it (aside from the obvious added functionality), and for first-time buyers, the default model is definitely worth $50. It looks great, sounds good, and provides an affordable way to access Alexa and control your smart home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fdW9QpFUSBjNMTYTGdjFggaOH9Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Generation-5-Comparison-6841e2f32a734282b509976489bd0383.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049363/7443" target="_top" id="2049363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049363/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-vs-Apple-HomePod-Mini"><a href="#Amazon-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-vs-Apple-HomePod-Mini" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen) vs. Apple HomePod Mini"></a><strong>Amazon Echo Dot (4th Gen) vs. Apple HomePod Mini</strong></h2><p> Apple announced the release of its<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-homepod-4146975" >HomePod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Mini speaker, and it’s available for sale in November. The Siri-powered HomePod Mini is 3.3 inches tall, and it has a somewhat similar spherical shape to the Echo Dot. The HomePod Mini has a three-mic array, compared to the Dot’s four-mic array. However, the HomePod Mini has Apple’s S5 chip, and it’s in a higher price category at $99.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Primarily a design upgrade.</strong></p><p> The new Echo Dot is a great speaker at a great price, but it’s not worth an upgrade if you already have the 3rd-gen Dot unless you’re going with the clock version. For first time buyers, it’s a no-brainer.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Echo Dot (4th Gen)</li><li>Product Brand  Amazon</li><li>Price  $49.99</li><li>Weight  12 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.94 x 3.94 x 3.53 in.</li><li>Color  Charcoal, Glacier White, Twilight Blue</li><li>Warranty  90-day limited</li><li>Compatibility  Alexa app (iOS 11.0+, Android 6.0+, or Fire OS 5.3.3+)</li><li>Ports  3.5 mm audio out</li><li>Voice Assistant  Alexa</li><li>Connectivity  Dual-band Wi-Fi supports 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac (2.4 and 5 GHz) networks, Bluetooth</li><li>Microphones  4</li><li>Speakers  1.6-inch built-in front-firing speaker</li><li>What’s included  Echo Dot, power adapter (15W), and Quick Start Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-be-bold-on-igtv-the-10-cutting-edge-video-concepts-for-your-brand/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Be Bold on IGTV The 10 Cutting-Edge Video Concepts for Your Brand</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/amazon-primes-social-standings-top-watchers-and-likers-twitter-2023-for-2024/"><u>Amazon Prime's Social Standings - Top Watchers and Likers Twitter, 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-google-nest-wi-fi-router-fast-and-effortless-wireless-coverage/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the Google Nest Wi-Fi Router: Fast & Effortless Wireless Coverage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/exploring-yokus-island-express-an-unexpected-journey-through-gaming/"><u>Exploring Yoku's Island Express: An Unexpected Journey Through Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-check-if-your-oppo-reno-10-pro-5g-is-unlocked-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Check if Your Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G Is Unlocked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-gmail-password-on-realme-gt-neo-5-se-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset Gmail Password on Realme GT Neo 5 SE Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/seamless-pet-feeding-solutions-discover-arfs-auto-feed-station/"><u>Seamless Pet Feeding Solutions: Discover Arf's Auto Feed Station</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Ideally, your TV will be viewable from just about any angle and offer great contrast. You want the blacks to be deep and rich without losing clarity of important details in a dark-lit scene.</p><p> Some of the best TV models use <a class="link"   href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/" >full-array local dimming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to dim parts of the screen that are supposed to be dark.

Like all OLED TV models, it can deliver inky blacks, wide viewing angles, and stunning visuals. But thanks to LG’s use of a <a class="link"   href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Micro Lens Array <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the G3 can also get significantly brighter than the company’s older OLED TVs. This makes the G3 an excellent option for not just dark room viewing but also bright rooms.</p><p> Beyond the impressive picture quality, the LG G3 also comes with <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/" >Dolby Vision <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >Atmos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support and can send Dolby and DTS audio to a connected soundbar via the <a class="link"   href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/" >eARC port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Its gaming features are also among the best on the market. You get a 120Hz refresh rate, four HDMI 2.1 ports to connect your gaming consoles or PC, low input lag, and a fast response time. The TV supports <a class="link"   href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-samsung-galaxy-a24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Nvidia G-Sync <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/" >AMD FreeSync <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/" >HDMI Forum VRR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for virtually tear-free gaming.</p><p> Plus, the TV has a sleek design and is meant to be mounted on a wall. The company even supplies a low-profile mount in the box. But unfortunately, you don’t get a tabletop stand. Also, you’ll need to pay for all of these features, as LG’s flagship television is not cheap.</p><p> But it’s hard to go wrong with the G3 if you have the budget.

As a result, you get more than a bang for your buck.</p><p> One of the biggest upgrades in the U6K over the previous generations is the inclusion of <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Mini-LED backlighting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which allows the TV to deliver a much better local dimming performance. So the TV produces better blacks and has an improved contrast ratio. Combined with the <a class="link"   href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-poco-x6-pin-codepattern-lockpassword-by-drfone-android/" >quantum dot technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, this results in excellent picture quality with lifelike visuals.</p><p> One improvement that we would have liked to see as a result of the Mini-LED backlighting is higher <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/" >peak brightness <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unfortunately, the TV tops out at around 600 nits, which isn’t shabby for a budget TV, but still not outstanding.</p><p> Among other highlights, the TV supports <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-10-hashtag-trackers-on-facebook-twitter-and-instagram-networks/" >Dolby Vision IQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mirthful-content-extraction-report/" >HDR10+ Adaptive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and HDR10. So this set will have no trouble decoding all types of HDR content.</p><p> The U6K is also a decent option for casual gaming. But there are no advanced features, so you are stuck with a 60Hz refresh rate. That said, Hisense has included VRR support to remove some screen tearing from games.</p><p> Lastly, Google TV handles software duties, giving you access to all your streaming services and Google Assistant.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hisense-u6k-small-1.png"                      alt="hisense-u6k-small-1"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Budget 4K TV</p><h5 id="Hisense-U6K-Series-1"><a href="#Hisense-U6K-Series-1" class="headerlink" title="Hisense U6K Series"></a>Hisense U6K Series</h5><p>The U6K from Hisense is an excellent value for money.

href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/fix-starfields-unwanted-behavior-no-more-pc-freezing-or-crashing-moments/" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the latest and greatest Wi-Fi standard that promises considerable improvements in wireless bandwidth and latency <a class="link"   href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/optimizing-your-pc-with-new-amd-driver-updates-on-windows-10117-what-you-need-to-know/" >compared to Wi-Fi 6E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-thorough-analysis-for-easy-dynamic-range-photography/" >earlier Wi-Fi standards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The most noticeable improvement most Wi-Fi 7 routers bring to the table is found on the hardware side. Many Wi-Fi 7-compatible routers offer multi-Gigabit <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-extract-and-save-fb-videos-the-cutting-edge-of-top-5/" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suitable for everyone who wants to max out their Multi-Gig internet plans.</p><p> In other words, the first thing you should look for if you’re rocking a <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s24-by-drfone-android/" >Multi-Gig internet plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that the router you’re eyeing comes with 2.5Gbps and&#x2F;or 10Gbps LAN and WAN ports. Another major improvement is the 320MHz wide 6GHz band instead of the 160MHz width found on Wi-Fi 6E and older routers.</p><p> Some other improvements found in <a class="link"   href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02815.pdf" >Wi-Fi 7 documentation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> aren’t fully implemented yet, or at all. For example, Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) and Multi-Link Operation (MLO)—where a router combines the 5GHz and 6GHz bands in a single <a class="link"   href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-from-poco-c65-devices-by-drfone-android/" >SSID <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to reach higher speeds and offer better coverage—aren’t found by default in many Wi-Fi 7 routers, and these features are being added via firmware updates. Not only that, but Windows 11 won’t support MLO until H2, 2024 at the earliest. So, make sure to update your router regularly to be able to use its full feature suite.</p><p> On top of that, there’s the pricing. Even budget Wi-Fi 7 offerings cost as much as high-end <a class="link"   href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-spotify-location-after-moving-to-another-country-on-vivo-s17-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-ways-to-sync-contacts-from-apple-iphone-xr-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/" >Wi-Fi 6E routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That said, unless you need multiple 10Gbps ports, you’ll be fine with a budget Wi-Fi 7 router.</p><p> Another tidbit worth mentioning includes the quad-band feature present on certain Wi-Fi 7 routers. Wi-Fi 7, like Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, uses three frequency bands for communication with clients: 2.4GHz, <a class="link"   href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/essential-solutions-top-twelve-challenges-of-using-the-iphone-12-and-tips-for-resolution/" >5GHz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and 6GHz. At least for now, the way to get a four-band router is to split one of the bands—usually the 5GHz one—in two. This can hurt the stability and bandwidth of both 5GHz bands compared to tri-band routers, so we recommend sticking to three-band solutions when possible.</p><p> To summarize, the most important thing when in the market for a Wi-Fi 7 router is the number and maximum bandwidth of <a class="link"   href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/comprehensible-techniques-for-effective-classroom-recordings-on-mac/" >LAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-decoding-the-mysteries-of-effective-youtube-keywords/" >WAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports. Next, you should look for AFC and MLO support, but be aware that these two features may be added to a router via a future firmware update. Also, don’t fall for the four-band feature because, most likely, the fourth band was obtained by splitting one of the bands in two. Finally, price-wise, expect to spend at least $250-$300, even if you’re after a budget Wi-Fi 7 router.

Plus, there are four Gigabit Ethernet ports with <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-motorola-moto-g84-5g-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >link aggregation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port that can be used for network-attached storage.</p><p> While you may not need the claimed range of 3,500 square feet, the RS700S still provides excellent coverage. When placed in the center, it can cover around 2,000-2,500 square feet while delivering a good experience. This is enough for an average US home, but if you have an even larger coverage area, you’ll be better off with <a class="link"   href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-rapid-tiktok-downloads-flawless-mp4-format-conversions/" >a mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Not only does the RS700S deliver high performance, but it also boasts a visually appealing design. Unfortunately, the Netgear offering doesn’t support <a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-cricket-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-for-free-by-drfone-ios/" >Multi-Link Operation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, one of Wi-Fi 7’s highlight features. However, it will be added in a future firmware update. The RS700S also requires you to pay for the Armor security service after the first free year, and the Smart Parental Controls is another premium add-on feature after a 30-day trial.</p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPQYSXCW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001123&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-wi-fi-7-routers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Asus ROG Rapture GT-BE98 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an impressive quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that you can consider as an alternative. It’s more expensive than the RS700S, but you don’t need to pay for additional services, and it’s more feature-rich. It’s marketed as a gaming router, so it has a gamer aesthetic, but otherwise, it is as non-compromising a Wi-Fi 7 router as you can get right now.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/netgear-nighthawk-rs700s.png"                      alt="netgear nighthawk rs700s"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Wi-Fi 7 Router Overall</p><h5 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-RS700S-1"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-RS700S-1" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk RS700S"></a>Netgear Nighthawk RS700S</h5><p>$650 $700 Save $50 </p><p>The Netgear Nighthawk RS700S is a top choice for those seeking a high-performing Wi-Fi 7 router.

Compared to its more powerful cousin, the BE800, the BE550 only comes with 2.5Gbps LAN and WAN ports; you won’t find 10Gbps ports here.</p><p> Next, wireless speeds are slower, with the maximum you can get over 6GHz being set at 5,760Mbps, the 5GHz channel maxing out at 2,880Mbps, and the 2.4GHz spectrum topping out at 574Mbps. Other cutbacks include only six antennas instead of eight, translating to weaker long-range performance. Still, even with only six antennas, the TP-Link Archer BE550 has pretty good coverage compared to most Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E devices.</p><p> We like that the TP-Link Archer BE550 is much more compact compared to TP-Link’s high-end Wi-Fi 7 routers; you can tuck this one almost anywhere in your home. As for the rest of the features, you’ve got support for MLO, Multi-RU, 4K-QAM, and the 320MHz-wide 6GHz channel.</p><p> The TP-Link Archer BE550 is a very nice budget Wi-Fi 7 router. It offers solid coverage, excellent wireless speeds, and 2.5Gbps wired connectivity. While its price is quite high and similar to a high-end Wi-Fi 6E router, it’s one of the more budget-friendly options in the Wi-Fi 7 world.</p><p> If you don’t care too much about wired connectivity, you can find a <a class="link"   href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/TP-Link-Archer-BE9300-Router-Tri-Band-WiFi-7-Wireless-Router-up-to-9-2-Gbps-Speeds-Easy-Setup-Parental-Controls/3339006219" >lower-end version of the BE550 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for $50 cheaper, which comes with three 1Gbps LAN ports and one 2.5Gbps LAN port instead of four 2.5Gbps ports.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tp-link-archer-be550.png"                      alt="TP Link Archer BE550"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Budget Wi-Fi 7 Router</p><h5 id="TP-Link-Archer-BE550-1"><a href="#TP-Link-Archer-BE550-1" class="headerlink" title="TP-Link Archer BE550"></a>TP-Link Archer BE550</h5><p>$249 $300 Save $51 </p><p>Despite being marketed as a budget Wi-Fi 7 router, there’s nothing budget about the TP-Link BE550.

This fast Wi-Fi 7 router offers multiple 10Gbps ports, the full suite of Wi-Fi 7 features, a couple of gaming-focused features, excellent coverage, and best-in-class wireless performance.</p><p> This three-band router can reach up to 1,376Mbps over the 2.4GHz band, up to 5,764Mbps over the 5GHz channel, and up to 11,529Mbps over the 6GHz spectrum. That’s pretty snappy, and thanks to the inclusion of eight external antennas, you should expect pretty good coverage.</p><p> Another positive is the support for ASUS AiMesh technology, allowing you to seamlessly build a mesh setup with the RT-BE96U at its heart. That said, you’ll have to wait for ASUS to release its Wi-Fi 7 <a class="link"   href="https://www.asus.com/networking-iot-servers/whole-home-mesh-wifi-system/zenwifi-wifi-systems/asus-zenwifi-bq16-pro/" >BQ16 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> mesh system to be able to build a Wi-Fi 7 mesh network.</p><p> Of course, you’re also getting the usual suite of gaming-oriented features like Game Boost, which prioritizes game-related data packets, and Mobile Game Mode you can enable in the ASUS mobile router app that cuts down latency and prioritizes your smartphone traffic when playing online games on it.</p><p> The router is whisper quiet thanks to the robust cooling solution that includes multiple heatsinks and a massive aluminum plate for expedited heat dissipation. We also like the fact that you’re getting advanced parental controls, VPN support including WireGuard, and most ASUS AiProtection features—auto-updates, malicious site blocking, firewall, time scheduling, manual blacklist filters, and more—free of charge.</p><p> On the other hand, there’s the expensive price, the Instant Guard mobile app that’s required for the majority of advanced features, and the fact that the MLO support—a major Wi-Fi 7 feature that reduces latency and thus improves your online gaming experience—should arrive sometime soon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/asus-rt-be96u.png"                      alt="ASUS RT-BE96U"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Gaming Wi-Fi 7 Router</p><h5 id="Asus-RT-BE96U-1"><a href="#Asus-RT-BE96U-1" class="headerlink" title="Asus RT-BE96U"></a>Asus RT-BE96U</h5><p>$630 $700 Save $70 </p><p>While not a dedicated gaming router, the ASUS RT-BE96U comes with a suite of gaming-specific features that prioritize your gaming sessions, even when you game on your smartphone.

The 3-pack offering is very expensive and features quite a massive design of both the main router and satellites. On the flip side, the Orbi 970 offers shockingly fast connection speeds, 10Gbps wired backhaul, up to 10,000ft² coverage with the router-and-two-satellites setup, and multiple 2.5Gbps wired LAN ports found on both the primary node and satellites.</p><p> The Orbi 970 features quad-band support, with the 5GHz frequency split in half to achieve the quad-band status. One of the two 5GHz channels is reserved for wireless backhaul unless you’re only using the router unit. In other words, most Orbi 970 mesh system owners will only have access to three bands.</p><p> Regarding maximum bandwidth, you’re looking at up to 1,147Mbps over the 2.4GHz band, a max bandwidth of 5,765Mbps on the 5GHz channel, and up to 11,530Mbps when using the 6GHz band. The second 5GHz channel, reserved for wireless backhaul when using satellites, can offer up to 8,647Mbps.</p><p> Aside from superb coverage and multiple Multi-Gig LAN ports on both the main unit and satellites, the Orbi 970 mesh system comes with all the Wi-Fi 7 goodies you’d expect, including MLO, Multi-RU, 4K-QAM, and 320MHz 6GHz channel.</p><p> Regarding downsides, since only a single 10Gbps LAN port is found on both the central unit and satellites, 10Gbps wired backhaul is only possible between the main unit and one of the satellites. The secondary satellite is limited to 2.5Gbps wired backhaul. Next, there’s the issue with the price and the fact that each extra satellite will set you back an additional $900.

This is the price of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Linksys-Velop-BE11000-WiFi-System/dp/B0CGKPJR14?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001123&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-wi-fi-7-routers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Linksys Velop Pro 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> three-pack mesh system.</p><p> The affordability, at least compared to other Wi-Fi mesh options, comes with a catch in the form of being limited to a 1Gbps wired connection. While the Linksys Velop Pro 7 features a 2.5Gbps WAN port, LAN ports are limited to 1Gbps. This means that the wired backhaul is stuck at 1Gbps and that you cannot go Multi-Gig on wired clients.</p><p> While the wired portion of the equation is stuck in the 1Gbps land, wireless bandwidth is high enough to max out that 2.5Gbps WAN port. The Linksys Velop Pro 7 can reach up to 574Mbps over the 2.4GHz channel, up to 4,320Mbps over the 5GHz spectrum, and up to 5,760Mbps when using the 6GHz band. This is a simple three-band mesh system with the wireless backhaul dynamically switching between the channels, always trying to use the least congested band.</p><p> The Velop Pro 7 mesh system comes with the usual collection of Wi-Fi 7 features, such as the 320MHz-wide 6GHz channel, 4K-QAM, MLO, and others. Concerning coverage, Velop promises up to 3,000ft² of coverage with a single unit.</p><p> While we like the overall design and compact dimensions compared to other Wi-Fi 7 and many Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E mesh solutions, pretty good wireless performance, and a relatively affordable price for the three-pack setup, limited wired connection speeds combined with the WAN port limited to 2.5Gbps make the Linksys Velop Pro 7 less than ideal option for demanding users.</p><p> If you’re living in a house or apartment that you can fully cover with only two mesh units, think about getting the two-pack <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4W31L4N/ref=twister%5FB0C586KK98?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001123&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-wi-fi-7-routers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >TP-Link Deco BE85 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> mesh system instead.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The TP-Link Archer A6 is a dual-band gigabit router that’s designed to provide some nice upgrades and features at a budget-friendly price. It includes features like dual 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO beamforming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , marking it out as a great upgrade for anyone using a budget router that’s more than a few years old. It does lack some features you can get out of a slightly higher priced budget unit, but the overall balance of feature set to price is attractive.</p><p> Specifications don’t always tell the whole story, so I recently spent about five days with a TP-Link Archer A6 plugged into my own network. I tested how well it holds up under daily use with a lot of data-hungry devices connected at once, tested top speeds and range on both bands, and more.</p><h2 id="Design-Improved-over-older-designs"><a href="#Design-Improved-over-older-designs" class="headerlink" title="Design: Improved over older designs"></a><strong>Design: Improved over older designs</strong></h2><p> The Archer A6 doesn’t exactly stand out of the crowd, but it’s a definite improvement over the older C7 that I keep around for testing purposes. Instead of the flat or glossy black finish seen on most routers, the A6 has a two-tone crosshatched pattern that creates an interesting visual effect. The edges are rounded instead of angular, and the top actually curves gently downward when viewed head-on.</p><p> The A6 features four antennas, two on the back, and the other two on the sides. They rotate easily for better positioning, but they aren’t removable. That’s a bit of a knock on this unit, as the ability to remove and replace antennas is pretty standard even in budget devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eeaRHW4APuNCYThw1t-TVwYpmSI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_WirelessRouters_ArcherA6AC1200_04-4739ffd6705348959e05e41ab9da2292.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer A6 AC1200"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> The ports and power button are all found on the back of the unit in a fairly standard array, and you’ll find the indicator LEDs on top near the front edge. The positioning is good for desktop use, and it also leaves the indicators clearly visible when wall mounted.</p><p> The Archer A6 doesn’t exactly stand out of the crowd, but it’s a definite improvement over the older C7 that I keep around for testing purposes.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Completely-painless-once-you-unwrap-the-antennas"><a href="#Setup-Process-Completely-painless-once-you-unwrap-the-antennas" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Completely painless once you unwrap the antennas"></a><strong>Setup Process: Completely painless once you unwrap the antennas</strong></h2><p> This router comes fully assembled, which makes it a bit easier and faster to set up than most. I’m not a fan of the fact that you can’t remove the antennas, but it definitely saves a bit of time. Unfortunately, that saved time is mostly wiped out by the ridiculous wrap job TP-Link does on the side antennas.</p><p> The rear antennas are loosely wrapped in a sticky film that you’re probably familiar with if you’ve ever unboxed a router, but the side antennas are shrink-wrapped in a resilient material that I was unable to remove by hand. I eventually resorted to a razor blade to carefully slice the antennas free without damaging them.</p><p> This router comes fully assembled, which makes it a bit easier and faster to set up than most.</p><p> Once you finish unwrapping the antennas, setting up the Archer A6 is a breeze. I didn’t even have to reboot my modem when I swapped the A6 for the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/eero-pro-mesh-wi-fi-system-review-4797008" >Eero router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I normally use. Getting the router up and running was literally a matter of plugging in the Ethernet cables, powering it up, and logging into the web interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2zSHbpT2Rq4Ac-0-u73213g1rlk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_WirelessRouters_ArcherA6AC1200_02-8fd53e1cd8284fd4a40091d7896fe8db.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer A6 AC1200"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Dual-band-with-MU-MIMO-but-lacking-in-physical-ports"><a href="#Connectivity-Dual-band-with-MU-MIMO-but-lacking-in-physical-ports" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Dual-band with MU-MIMO, but lacking in physical ports"></a><strong>Connectivity: Dual-band with MU-MIMO, but lacking in physical ports</strong></h2><p> The TP-Link Archer A6 is an AC1200<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that supports MU-MIMO beamforming. The total throughput is a little on the light side if you have a lot of devices, but MU-MIMO is a nice feature to see in such an affordable unit.</p><p> On the physical side, the A6 comes with a bare minimum single WAN port and four LAN ports. There isn’t even a single USB port, so you can’t use this router to host a networked USB drive. That isn’t completely unexpected from a budget router, but it would have been nice if it included at least one USB port.</p><p> On the physical side, the A6 comes with a bare minimum single WAN port and four LAN ports.

That’s more or less in line with other routers I tested at the same time, although my Eero did notch a maximum download speed of 627Mbps during that same round of testing.</p><p> Next up, I connected to the 5GHz wireless network a few feet from the router. Using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.speedtest.net/" >Ookla speed test <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, I measured the top download speed of 249Mbps and an upload speed of 64Mbps. That’s plenty fast for gaming, streaming 4K video, and just about everything else, but it’s much slower than I’ve seen out of higher-end routers on the same connection.</p><p> The next test was performed about 15 feet from the router with a closed-door blocking the signal. At that range, the Archer A6 actually stepped up its performance a little, possibly due to my test device seeing less interference in the hallway than in my office. I saw a maximum download speed of 365Mpbs and an upload of 64Mbps at that distance.</p><p> I performed the next test about 50 feet away, with several walls, furniture, and appliances blocking the signal. At that range, the download speed dropped to 195 Mbps. That’s still a pretty good performance, although the much more expensive ASUS ROG Rapture I tested at the same time held tight with download speeds of 395Mbps at the same distance.</p><p> For my final test, I headed down to my garage, putting about a hundred feet and a significant amount of obstructions in the way. My mobile device was only able to connect to the 2.4Ghz network at that range, and it notched a download speed of 13.4Mbps. That’s workable, but it’s also a sign that you may end up needing a Wi-Fi range extender with the Archer A6 even if your house isn’t that large.</p><p> You may end up needing a Wi-Fi range extender with the Archer A6 even if your house isn’t that large.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Basic-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Basic-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Basic and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Basic and easy to use</strong></h2><p> The Archer A6 uses the same familiar web interface TP-Link has used for years. If you’ve ever used a TP-Link router before, you’ll already be familiar with the system. If you haven’t, it’s very easy to pick up.</p><p> The interface is laid out in two tabs, basic and advanced, with an optional quick setup. Click the quick setup, and it will run you through all the basics to get the router up and running, set up both wireless networks and basic settings that work well enough for most people.</p><p> The basic tab provides you with the most important information, like the status of your internet connection and Wi-Fi networks, and how many devices are currently connected. You can easily access internet settings, wireless settings, parental controls, and fire up the guest network if you need it.</p><p> The advanced tab digs down into settings like parental controls, where you can set profiles to block access to certain content and create time limits, the firewall, and NAT forwarding.</p><p> In addition to the web interface, TP-Link also offers a phone app that lets you change basic settings. Advanced settings have to be accessed through the web portal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2qgk2j764OivVDjAgICPpQb-Xig=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_WirelessRouters_ArcherA6AC1200_03-7abb56dd933947dc892f8ec43ef36863.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer A6 AC1200"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Good-price-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Good-price-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good price for the features"></a><strong>Price: Good price for the features</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $50, the Archer A6 represents pretty decent value for the level of performance and the feature set it offers. You may want to step up to a more expensive unit if you have a big house or a lot of devices, and it is missing features like a USB port, but the Archer A6 is priced very well for what you get.</p><h2 id="TP-Link-Archer-A6-vs-TP-Link-Archer-A7"><a href="#TP-Link-Archer-A6-vs-TP-Link-Archer-A7" class="headerlink" title="TP-Link Archer A6 vs. TP-Link Archer A7"></a><strong>TP-Link Archer A6 vs. TP-Link Archer A7</strong></h2><p> Don’t let the numbering scheme confuse you. The Archer A7 (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC1750-Smart-WiFi-Router/dp/B079JD7F7G%2520/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846342%7Cndd707df741a44bb699bcdb4f97d36f3622%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is actually an older device than the A6. It’s also a little more expensive, with an MSRP of $80 and a little faster, with an AC1750 rating compared to the AC1200 of the Archer A6.</p><p> The most important difference between these two routers is that the Archer A6 uses a newer chipset that allows it to offer MU-MIMO beamforming. The A6 also features four antennas compared to just three from the A7. So while the Archer A7 is rated at slightly higher speeds, the A6 actually performs better in the real world while still coming in at a lower price.</p><p> The Archer A7 is an example of a slightly more expensive router that provides the option to connect a USB drive, but the A6 still comes out on top due to the lower price point and more advanced chipset.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A great budget router that provides premium features.</strong></p><p> The TP-Link Archer A6 is a great little budget-priced router that performs better than I expected it to. It’s important to stress that it’s an AC1200 router, and it’s only dual-band, so don’t expect it to do the job if you have dozens of data-hungry devices or an especially large house with a complicated internal setup. But if you just want an affordable router that performs well across about 1,400-1,600 square feet of space, this is a great option.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Archer A6 AC1200 Gigabit Smart Wi-Fi Router</li><li>Product Brand  TP-Link</li><li>SKU  AC1200</li><li>Price  $49.99</li><li>Weight  1.76 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  9.1 x 5.7 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Speed  5GHz: Up to 867Mbps &amp; 2.4GHz: Up to 300Mbps</li><li>Warranty  Two years</li><li>Compatbility  Windows 10&#x2F;8.1&#x2F;8&#x2F;7&#x2F;Vista&#x2F;XP&#x2F;2000&#x2F;NT&#x2F;98SE, MacOS, Netware, Unix or Linux</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antennas  4</li><li>Number of Bands  Dual-band</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  4x ethernet ports, 1x WAN port</li><li>Chipset  Qualcomm QCA9886</li><li>Range  Medium homes</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mining-marvels-5-best-map-locations-in-terraria/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mining Marvels 5 Best Map Locations in Terraria</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/he-framework-for-an-epic-youtube-series/"><u>[New] The Framework for an Epic YouTube Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-clip-composition-blending-modes-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Clip Composition Blending Modes Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-maximize-content-impact-with-youtubes-movie-maker-tools-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Content Impact with YouTube's Movie Maker Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionary-virtual-wisdom-for-modern-souls/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionary Virtual Wisdom for Modern Souls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/approach-consider-how-bone-health-impacts-overall-treatment-strategies-in-metastatic-cancer/"><u>Approach: Consider How Bone Health Impacts Overall Treatment Strategies in Metastatic Cancer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/buyers-choice-elite-blu-ray-drive-reviews-and-picks/"><u>Buyer's Choice: Elite Blu-Ray Drive Reviews and Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-the-garmin-forerunner-amoeba-745-a-game-changer-in-fitness-tracking-technology/"><u>Comprehensive Review: The Garmin Forerunner Amoeba 745 - A Game Changer in Fitness Tracking Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-the-elegance-of-skagen-falster-2-the-sleek-challenger-to-apples-dominance/"><u>Discover the Elegance of Skagen Falster 2 - The Sleek Challenger to Apple's Dominance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-the-activation-lock-on-your-ipad-and-iphone-8-without-apple-account-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Remove the Activation Lock On your iPad and iPhone 8 without Apple Account</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-migrate-android-data-from-poco-x6-pro-to-new-android-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Migrate Android Data From Poco X6 Pro to New Android Phone?

With a 10th generation<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >Intel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> processor and a multitude of configuration options, the R11 lets you choose an up-to-date PC that fits in your price range now, and then upgrade later on. The Dell subsidiary’s latest beast comes in six main configurations, ranging from a base model (priced at $930) all the way up to a top tier model that includes two graphics cards (priced at $4,956). I tested the Alienware Aurora R11 for two weeks, evaluating its design, performance, gameplay, audio, network performance, software, upgradability, and cooling. Is the Alienware Aurora R11 a worthwhile investment? Here’s my full review.</p><h2 id="Test-model-10th-Gen-Intel-Core-i7-10700F-and-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-2060"><a href="#Test-model-10th-Gen-Intel-Core-i7-10700F-and-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-2060" class="headerlink" title="Test model: 10th Gen Intel Core i7 10700F and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060"></a><strong>Test model: 10th Gen Intel Core i7 10700F and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060</strong></h2><p> The Aurora R11 is extremely customizable, and you can choose exactly the components you want. You can select either a 10th Gen Core i5, i7, or i9 processor, and for graphics, you can get the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER if you go for the base model, or go all the way up to two (yes, two!) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti cards in the highest tier model.</p><p> In some of the lower-tier models, you can opt for an AMD card. In the second tier, you can swap out an AMD Radeon RX 5700 (8GB GDDR6) graphics card for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6) at no additional cost. You can choose your chassis, liquid or air cooling, different wattages, single or dual drives, and different amounts and types of storage.</p><p> I tested the second-tier model with the 10th Gen Intel Core i7 10700F, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6), 16 GB of RAM, dual drives (256GB SSD + 1TB SATA), and the Dark Side of the Moon chassis with Low-Profile Smart Cooling CPU Heatsink and 550W Power Supply. The model I tested had air cooling, but you can get liquid cooling in this model for as little as $20 added to the base price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hRBDZ5clhMthsEMeqGYzOi7oIE8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-2-e6bece84be7c48a3af3db3806a85a31e.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111965/7443" target="_top" id="2111965">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111965" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111965/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-mature-gaming-rig"><a href="#Design-A-mature-gaming-rig" class="headerlink" title="Design: A mature gaming rig"></a><strong>Design: A mature gaming rig</strong></h2><p> While some gaming PC towers boast bold designs with transparent glass, RGB fans, and enough colors to make you feel like you’re at a rave, the Aurora R11 takes a much different design approach. The R11 is unassuming—not too flashy and not too loud. It’s elegant and simple in appearance with subtle strips of lighting on the front trim of the oblong chassis. This looks like a computer for someone with refined taste, as opposed to a colorful spectacle.</p><p> The front is reminiscent of a jet engine, with a raised front panel surrounded by venting slots. The Aurora R11 is large, and takes up a significant amount of space when placed on top of a desk. Clocking in at 17 x 8.8 x 18.9 inches, this is a tower you’d want to place under your desk. I placed it under my desk, but used a lift to help keep the tower off of the floor.</p><p> The Aurora R11 comes in two different chassis color options: A lunar light chassis and a dark side of the moon chassis. The dark side of the moon chassis is all black, while the lunar light option is white with a black front panel. When you power on the R11, the RGB halo ring illuminates around the front panel, and the Alienware symbol lights up. The Alienware symbol doubles as the power button, and you can tune its color, tune how it blinks, and create Macros for specific games. I created a fun blinking Macro for Destiny 2, then quickly got distracted by it and got rid of it. You can, however, set a macro to dim things down while playing and amp it up other times.</p><p> There are ports galore on this rig. It has multiple USB ports, and it even has USB-C ports. One of the front USB ports has PowerShare, which is a nice feature for charging devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075476/7443" target="_top" id="2075476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-OC-Ready"><a href="#Display-OC-Ready" class="headerlink" title="Display: OC Ready"></a><strong>Display: OC Ready</strong></h2><p> The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6) has a base clock of 1,365 MHz. The card is OC ready though, so it’s built for overclocking. It supports a maximum resolution of up to 7680 x 4320. The card also supports VR, and multiple monitors (up to four).</p><p> The Aurora R11 doesn’t include a monitor in the package. I connected the R11 to the FreeSync and G-Sync compatible Asus VG245H gaming monitor, which is a 24-inch 1920 x 1080 monitor with a max refresh rate of 144 Hz. Colors displayed as expected, and the text was sharp and clear. Videos ran smoothly, and I didn’t encounter any issues whatsoever with the display quality, nor any of the video port connections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JFFJbdkvNwhJ-T2_-B88xFQhCNQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-4-d7147c6bd520432285a9f2e58f788322.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-An-absolute-powerhouse"><a href="#Performance-An-absolute-powerhouse" class="headerlink" title="Performance: An absolute powerhouse"></a><strong>Performance: An absolute powerhouse</strong></h2><p> I was impressed with the R11’s overall performance, especially considering the model I tested is one of the more affordable configurations. Boot times are fast, and it jumps around different applications at lightning speed. It scored admirably in benchmark testing, clocking a single-core score of 4403 and a multi-core score of 33335 on Geekbench 3. On PCMark 10, it scored a 6692, which was better than 92% of all results. It scored highest in essentials and digital content creation and slightly lower in productivity.</p><p> When I connected a hard drive to one of the fast USB ports, games loaded up with impressive efficiency. The Aurora R11 was able to handle pretty much anything I threw at it.</p><p> Boot times are fast, and it jumps around different applications at lightning speed.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Played-most-games-on-the-highest-settings"><a href="#Gaming-Played-most-games-on-the-highest-settings" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Played most games on the highest settings"></a><strong>Gaming: Played most games on the highest settings</strong></h2><p> Although the rig I tested is a lower level Alienware Aurora R11 model, this is by no means a lower level gaming desktop. I would say it’s an upper-to-mid range, as it deftly handled most games on the highest level settings. The first game I tested was<a href="https://www.liveabout.com/destiny-2-cheat-codes-4158004"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> , not the most graphically intensive game but no slouch either, and it can definitely lag on some machines during intense action sequences. With the vsync cap set at 60, I turned_Destiny 2_ up to its highest setting, and it ran at a solid 60 FPS throughout.</p><p> Next, I ran_Far Cry 5_ , and the R11 rose to the occasion again. The R11 handled_Far Cry 5’s_ internal benchmark and maintained lag-free gaming on the ultra settings (staying at least at 60 FPS). In fact, during the internal benchmark on ultra, it ran an average of 98 FPS, with a low of 72 and a high of 115.</p><p> The R11 handled fighting games with ease. I tested_Tekken 7_ on Ultra, and it ran it consistently at 58 to 59 FPS. I also decided to give_A Total War Saga: Troy_ a try too. This ran on ultra settings with no issue at all, even in the largest battles. Zooming in and out was smooth and fast, and the game ran absolutely flawlessly.</p><p> There was only one game,<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> , where I saw the slightest bit of strain on the R11 on the highest settings. I noticed a bit of slow rendering, and the fan speed really kicked up. Even still, there was no stuttering or lagging, and_Deliverance_ is notorious for not being particularly well optimized.</p><p> The R11 has its moments—I did notice that the fans ramped at times, and I noticed a bit more warm air coming from the system on a few occasions. Of course, there are bound to be some games out there that could push the R11 to its limits, but nothing seemed to stop this beast during any game I threw at it.</p><p> The R11 handled Far Cry 5’s internal benchmark, and it maintained lag-free gaming on the ultra settings.</p><h2 id="Productivity-Free-optional-keyboard-and-optical-mouse"><a href="#Productivity-Free-optional-keyboard-and-optical-mouse" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Free optional keyboard and optical mouse"></a><strong>Productivity: Free optional keyboard and optical mouse</strong></h2><p> The Aurora R11 is designed as a gaming PC, but you could absolutely use it for work. Since this PC has ample processing power and gaming-grade graphics, you could also use it for photo or video editing. The R11 includes a free keyboard and optical mouse, but you have to specifically indicate that you want those free options. Otherwise, you’ll just get the tower and power cord.</p><h2 id="Audio-7-1-surround-sound"><a href="#Audio-7-1-surround-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: 7.1 surround sound"></a><strong>Audio: 7.1 surround sound</strong></h2><p> The R11 has a number of options for audio sources, including ports for connecting a microphone, headphones, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-surround-sound-1846802" >surround sound speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It even has an optical audio port. You should have no problem finding an audio solution that fits your needs. The R11 doesn’t include speakers in the box, but it does have integrated 7.1 channel audio (with SPDIF port).</p><h2 id="Network-Want-Wi-Fi-5-or-Wi-Fi-6"><a href="#Network-Want-Wi-Fi-5-or-Wi-Fi-6" class="headerlink" title="Network: Want Wi-Fi 5 or Wi-Fi 6?"></a><strong>Network: Want Wi-Fi 5 or Wi-Fi 6?</strong></h2><p> The R11 includes the Dell Wireless DW1810 802.11ac Wireless card (Wi-Fi, Wireless LAN, and Bluetooth 5.0). For $20 added to the price, you can upgrade to the Killer AX1650 (2x2) 802.11ax Wireless Card and get Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 capability.</p><p> The model I tested had the baseline Wi-Fi adapter without Wi-Fi 6, but still worked exceptionally well. In my home, my Wi-Fi speed maxes out at 400 Mbps. The R11 clocked a Wi-Fi speed of 320 Mbps, according to Ookla.</p><p> As long as you have a good router, the R11 will hold a great connection for gaming. I often have trouble with 5G networks in my house, but this adapter was rock solid, and I could maintain a stable 5G connection. Of course, you can also choose to hardwire and connect an Ethernet cable if you prefer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sCKseoBNmM15udE4RMrggTlWuBs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-5-6b37b663752e4eada4c8832152dd9882.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Software-Alienware-Command-Center"><a href="#Software-Alienware-Command-Center" class="headerlink" title="Software: Alienware Command Center"></a><strong>Software: Alienware Command Center</strong></h2><p> Like most gaming PCs, the R11 runs on Windows 10 Home. You can opt for additional software like Microsoft Office and McAfee antivirus protection while you’re customizing the PC during purchase.</p><p> The R11 also includes Alienware Command Center, which is one of the more useful applications. This proprietary app allows you to tune and create custom profiles for different games and programs. You can create special light settings for the tower, view your temperature history, adjust thermal settings for your fan or liquid cooling, customize audio tuning settings, set up power schedules, and more. Gamers can also view overclock settings for their GPU.</p><p> Another application, Alienware Mobile Connect, lets you connect your PC to your mobile device. You can do things like a text from the application, make calls, access images and contacts, and mirror your screen.</p><h2 id="Cooling-Air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling"><a href="#Cooling-Air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling" class="headerlink" title="Cooling: Air cooling vs. liquid cooling"></a><strong>Cooling: Air cooling vs. liquid cooling</strong></h2><p> The R11 comes in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >air cooled <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-cooling-832445" >liquid cooled <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> configurations. I tested an air-cooled configuration. There’s a fan in the front that sucks air into the PC, and then there’s larger venting along the top and sides that helps push the air through the PC to cool down the processors. The fans are strategically placed for the optimal airflow, with a fan on the top that helps promote air circulation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UQDwEbTk5WBApmQhcAofsrxJmAs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-6-5d0cca33ca56479e8f9f7cbe8202ac1a.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130874/7443" target="_top" id="2130874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Upgradability-A-latch-system"><a href="#Upgradability-A-latch-system" class="headerlink" title="Upgradability: A latch system"></a><strong>Upgradability: A latch system</strong></h2><p> The R11 is not quite as easy to open as a chassis with an easy-remove glass side panel, but it still offers easy upgradability. The tower opens with a lock and latch system that releases the side panel. Once you remove the side panel, you can move the power supply out of the way so you can better access the internals.</p><p> This is a system that will be easy to keep up to date. There’s room inside of the R11 for additional drives, and the configuration I tested supports up two more 2.5-inch hard drives with the spaces empty and ready to go.</p><p> If you opt for the liquid-cooled unit, your upgrading options could be more limited simply because it might be more difficult to find compatible parts. That is, unless you plan to stick with Alienware gear over the long run.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jzGkH061o51TFghPHwP5n6bmE34=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Alienware-Aurora-R11-Desktop-PC-3-7a87edbb11b041818dbf44880e3c79fd.jpg"                      alt="Alienware Aurora R11"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad"><a href="#Price-Not-bad" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad"></a><strong>Price: Not bad</strong></h2><p> The price of your R11 is going to vary widely depending on how much you want to put into it. You can get an Aurora R11 for under a grand though. The R11 configuration I tested retails for $1410, but it was $30 less because the test model included the lower tier chassis (without RGB lighting in the word “Alienware” along the side). For the lower tier models, the prices are reasonable, and you can upgrade the PC later on.</p><p> For the higher tier models, the prices are steep. The highest tier R11 costs just under five grand. For that price, many people would be happier building their own rig.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123729/7443" target="_top" id="2123729">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123729" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123729/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alienware-Aurora-R11-vs-HP-Omen-Obelisk"><a href="#Alienware-Aurora-R11-vs-HP-Omen-Obelisk" class="headerlink" title="Alienware Aurora R11 vs. HP Omen Obelisk"></a><strong>Alienware Aurora R11 vs. HP Omen Obelisk</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-omen-obelisk-review-5072832" >HP Omen Obelisk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a clean design, with sharp lines and angles and a glass side panel. It’s very different from the R11’s oval-shaped jet engine style. The Obelisk comes in different configurations, and the lowest tier model is $900 (comparable to the lowest tier Aurora R11). The lowest tier Obelisk includes the AMD Ryzen5 3500 Processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 (6 GB), while the lowest tier Aurora includes a 10th gen<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >Intel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> i5 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER 4GB GDDR6.

However, the Insta360 One X2 is one of a new breed of cameras that aim to uphold this age-old truth by capturing absolutely everything around them in a single spherical image. This opens up a wealth of opportunities from nifty editing tricks to easily capturing<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/virtual-reality-vr-definition-4155090" >VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> experiences.</p><h2 id="Design-A-chunky-waterproof-build"><a href="#Design-A-chunky-waterproof-build" class="headerlink" title="Design: A chunky, waterproof build"></a>Design: A chunky, waterproof build</h2><p> The Insta360 One X2 is a solid, chunky little rectangle. It’s compact enough to fit in a large pocket and feels quite rugged and durable, though those bulbous glass lens elements mean you’ll still want to be a little careful with it. Fortunately, it comes with a sleek neoprene case that offers a reassuring extra level of protection when you just want to carry the camera in your pocket.</p><p> The One X2 is fully waterproof down to 33 feet, which is a big improvement over its more sensitive predecessor.</p><p> Insta360 also includes a microfiber cloth, which is certainly useful, given the tendency for those lenses to attract smudges and dust. You also get a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> cable for charging, though a charging brick isn’t included.</p><p> The One X2 is fully waterproof down to 33 feet, which is a big improvement over its more sensitive predecessor. In order to accomplish this waterproofing, the battery compartment and USB port feature locking sealed doors. The locking mechanisms were a little tricky to open and close, but that’s a worthy trade-off for waterproofing. The battery doubles as the door to the battery compartment, and the microSD card slot is located within that compartment.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Controls consist of a shutter button, power button, and circular touchscreen.

This turned out to be a bit of a pain, with the Bluetooth connection used to activate the One X2 and set up the Wi-Fi connection repeatedly timing out and failing. Eventually, I got it up and running, and aside from the one hiccup, the process was fairly smooth, if more complex than I’d typically expect from a camera.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Good-light-a-necessity"><a href="#Image-Quality-Good-light-a-necessity" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Good light a necessity"></a>Image Quality: Good light a necessity</h2><p> My initial impressions of the Insta360 One X2 were tinted by the weather conditions in which I initially tested it. Here in Western Washington, winter can be gloomy and dark, so I ended up shooting in fairly dim conditions much of the time. As a result, I couldn’t help be shocked by how poor the video looked when I went to edit it. However, when given plenty of light to work with, the One X2 produced fairly decent-looking photos and video.</p><p> You really don’t have to worry about getting a stable shot even when walking or running on rough ground.</p><p> What’s really impressive is the degree of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optical-and-digital-image-stabilization-488000" >image stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that’s possible in this camera. It’s good enough that you really don’t have to worry about getting a stable shot even when walking or running on rough ground. With this in mind, you have to consider the Insta360 from a perspective of the intended purpose. Action cameras have always been action-focused, and this is even more true of 360 action cameras. Basically, you need to do something interesting that justifies the trade-offs.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> One thing to remember about the One X2 is that its 5.7K recording resolution isn’t as sharp and detailed as you might expect, and when you crop down to a standard 16:9 frame you end up with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837" >1080p <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . That’s good enough for viewing on a phone or small tablet, but the low resolution, as well as noise and image artifacts, become pretty significant when viewed on a large computer monitor.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938141">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938141">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938141%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938141/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Unimpressive-overall"><a href="#Audio-Unimpressive-overall" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Unimpressive overall"></a>Audio: Unimpressive overall</h2><p> The audio recording on the One X2 could be charitably described as mediocre. It’s there, and it’s useable, but in a camera that would otherwise be well suited to vlogging, given its portable size and ease of use, it’s a little disappointing.</p><h2 id="Storage-Requirements-Hefty-file-size"><a href="#Storage-Requirements-Hefty-file-size" class="headerlink" title="Storage Requirements: Hefty file size"></a>Storage Requirements: Hefty file size</h2><p> Though it may be the bare minimum for decent 360 footage, the 5.7L video footage the One X2 captures is still highly demanding in how much storage space it requires. A single short video clip easily takes up hundreds of megabytes of space, so you’ll want a big microSD card and plenty of hard drive space on your PC and&#x2F;or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Brilliant-but-buggy"><a href="#Software-Brilliant-but-buggy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Brilliant but buggy"></a>Software: Brilliant but buggy</h2><p> Most of my problems with the One X2 have to do with the Insta360 app, and the big one is with the difficulty of connecting to the camera. Every time I connected to the One X2, I had to tap the connect button in the app over and over again until it finally connected.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Once it’s connected, the app is rather cleverly designed with a basic but well-conceived, remote viewing and control interface and a brilliant editing suite for processing 360 videos. From framing your shot and changing playback speed to creating camera movements using keyframes, it’s an effective and highly intuitive tool that allows you to quickly and easily process your videos on the go.</p><p> The software on the One X2 itself is quite basic, but considering the small size of its circular touchscreen, this is understandable.</p><p> The app also includes a fully functional social media platform where you can share your work and interact with other creators. Really, there’s a lot bundled into the Insta360 app, and fortunately, every aspect of the app includes extensive tutorials, though the text in some of these tutorials has not been translated into English.</p><p> The software on the One X2 itself is quite basic, but considering the small size of its circular touchscreen, this is understandable. However, as a result of the lack of accessible settings in the camera, I ended up frequently going back into the app on my phone to tweak things in the camera. This made the connection issues I experienced all the more annoying.</p><p> It’s also possible to take more control of your video editing on the computer via either Insta360’s free editing studio software or via a plugin in Adobe Premiere. However, it was easier to get the shots I wanted by editing them on my phone via the app.</p><h2 id="Accessories-A-good-amount-of-options"><a href="#Accessories-A-good-amount-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: A good amount of options"></a>Accessories: A good amount of options</h2><p> A number of accessories are available for the Insta360 One X2. These include, among others, a diving enclosure and a “bullet time” attachment used to twirl the One X2 around your head. It’s also a good idea to have a selfie stick to use with the One X2, and I found a tripod handy for recording timelapse videos.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a>Price: Good value</h2><p> With an MSRP of $430, the One X2 is only a little more expensive than a high-end action camera, but it’s not bad for a 360 camera. It’s a good value if being able to shoot 360-degree video is a necessity for you.</p><h2 id="Insta360-One-X2-vs-GoPro-Hero-9-Black"><a href="#Insta360-One-X2-vs-GoPro-Hero-9-Black" class="headerlink" title="Insta360 One X2 vs. GoPro Hero 9 Black"></a>Insta360 One X2 vs. GoPro Hero 9 Black</h2><p> You may well be trying to decide between a 360 camera and a traditional action camera, in which case the obvious choice to match against the Insta360 One X2 is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/gopro-hero9-black-review-5120078" >GoPro HERO9 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . On the surface, the GoPro looks like the obvious choice for far better image and audio quality with better durability at a lower price point.
