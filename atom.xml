Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The mini3 by DDPai is unique among the dashboard cams we’ve tested because its primary function is as a social media and photography device, rather than as a basic security camera for your car. The picture quality was the best among the car cams we reviewed and is by far the most stylish and discreet. What really makes it stand out is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dash-cams-vs-dash-cam-apps-534883" >mobile app, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which adds a social media element that makes owing this device a lot of fun.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-21st-Century-Dashcam"><a href="#Design-21st-Century-Dashcam" class="headerlink" title="Design: 21st Century Dashcam"></a><strong>Design: 21st Century Dashcam</strong></h2><p> The first thing you notice about the mini3 is that the camera housing is smooth and cylindrical. Other dash cams are very square and bulky, so right out of the box, you know this is a different kind of camera. It’s very sleek and feels like it belongs in the 21st century.</p><p> The way the dash cam attaches to your windshield is also unique. Instead of a suction cup or dash mount, the mini3 has a specially-designed bracket that you slide the camera module into. The mount goes behind your rearview mirror so it is all but invisible to you while you drive. That’s a big contrast from the other models we tested that must be put somewhere within your field of view.</p><p> The DDPai mini3 has 32GB of onboard storage, so there’s no need to worry about changing microSD cards and keeping track of adapters.</p><p> It can achieve this ultra-low profile because it has no display. Instead, it uses your smartphone as the display via its mobile app, which means you’re required you to have a mobile device to use it.</p><p> The DDPai mini3 has 32GB of onboard storage, so there’s no need to worry about changing<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >microSD cards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and keeping track of adapters. You can review your footage and manage your memory directly in the mobile app and through the computer. It’s good to have one less part to keep track of.</p><p> It’s also the only dashcam we tested that’s wireless, generating its own Wi-Fi network to connect to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-makes-a-smartphone-smart-579597" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other mobile devices. This is really convenient because anyone that has the app can access the camera so long as they’re in the immediate vicinity of the car. Just remember to rename the Wi-Fi network and change the password for security reasons.</p><p> Like other dashcams we’ve reviewed, the mini3 comes equipped with a G-sensor and motion detection abilities. This allows it to act as a security guard for your car when you’re parked and as video backup in you’re ever in a traffic accident (although the Smart Parking Mode, which records while you’re parked, requires you to invest in DDPAI’s hard wire kit).</p><p> Another unusual feature is the ability to take still photography as you’re driving. The dashcam comes with a nifty remote control that’s shaped like an oversized bottle cap. If you see something you want to take a picture of, like a nice bit of scenery, push the remote’s button and the camera takes an extremely high-quality snapshot for you. You can also set it to take up to 30 seconds of video.</p><p> One of the downsides of this device is that it doesn’t allow you to adjust its loop recording feature. Other dash cams we tested let you choose to set the recordings at one, three, or five-minute intervals. With the mini3, all loop recordings are 1:37 seconds.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest downside to this dash cam is the fact that there is no battery, meaning it must be plugged into power at all times to record.</p><p> Another drawback is the sound. While it is by far the best sound recording quality we’ve encountered in a dashcam, it was often out of sync with what was happening on the screen.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest downside to this dash cam is the fact that there is no battery, meaning it must be plugged into power at all times to record. You have to buy a separate battery pack if you want to use the parking guard feature.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Read-the-manual-first"><a href="#Setup-Process-Read-the-manual-first" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Read the manual first"></a><strong>Setup Process: Read the manual first</strong></h2><p> The user manual for the DDPAI mini3 is detailed enough that you’ll know what everything does and how to use it. It starts you off by prompting you to download the app, which will walk you through the process of connecting to the camera’s Wi-Fi and give you a tour of its features. After that, you’re ready to go—it only takes about 10 minutes to be comfortably familiar with the mini3.</p><p> The most complex part is installing the power cable since you have to conceal the wire inside your car’s roof and side panels. DDPai has a<a class="link"   href="http://en.ddpai.com/product/mini/3.html" >good tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on how to do this, and the camera comes with all the necessary tools right in the box (something lesser cameras lack).</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mobile-App-What-sets-it-apart"><a href="#Mobile-App-What-sets-it-apart" class="headerlink" title="Mobile App: What sets it apart"></a><strong>Mobile App: What sets it apart</strong></h2><p> What really sets the mini3 apart from other dashcams is its mobile app. The user manual instructs you to download the DDPai app before you use the camera for the first time. Once it’s on your phone and paired with your camera, the app’s “Camera” tab contains all the tools you need to watch the live feed, control the camera, review footage, and adjust settings—all the things that make a car cam useful.</p><p> The “Camera” tab also gives you the ability to do basic video edits like trim and crop footage. This is also where you can download any of the loop recordings you want to keep from being overwritten when the 32GB card gets full.</p><p> However, it’s the organizational tools and social media features that make the mini3 more useful and fun than any other dashcam we reviewed. The app’s “On the Road” tab contains a very basic social media experience that allows you to browse videos and pictures that people have shared from all over the world. There are posts from users in many different countries, which is great if you love to travel or just want to see beautiful and candid views of places you’ve never been.</p><p> The app’s “Albums” tab is where you can find and organize all the photos and videos that you take with the remote. In our testing, the video we captured played back in jaw-dropping quality. It also provided interesting statistics for the timeframe it captured, like how many left turns you took, how many times you changed lanes, accelerated, and decelerated. It even goes into detail about the g-forces on the car and the slope of the road you’re driving on.</p><p> The “Profile” tab is where you can set up an account to share your own driving experiences with the world. This isn’t necessary to use the camera or browse other people’s posts, but it’s a really unique social network—try trading Twitter for a week and see which one is more fun!</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-4K-video-with-incredible-detail"><a href="#Camera-Quality-4K-video-with-incredible-detail" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: 4K video with incredible detail"></a><strong>Camera Quality: 4K video with incredible detail</strong></h2><p> True to the promise of its design, the camera is par excellence. It can capture footage in 4K resolution as well as 1600p using an f&#x2F;1.8 aperture that lets in more light. That, along with the camera’s high-capacity processor and image sensor, yields eye-popping detail, richness, and clarity. It is by orders of magnitude the highest-quality picture we’ve seen among the dashcams we’ve tested.</p><p> It can capture footage in 4K resolution as well as 1600p using an f&#x2F;1.8 aperture that lets in more light.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Always-there-for-you"><a href="#Performance-Always-there-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Always there for you"></a><strong>Performance: Always there for you</strong></h2><p> Once it was installed and ready to go, we drove this dashcam through the cities, suburbs, mountains, forests, and red rocks of Utah. Because the camera is so well-hidden behind the rearview mirror, we often forgot it was there. But when we passed a particularly scenic lake or rock formation, it was natural to just reach down and push the remote button to snap a picture.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856"                      border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Surprising-low-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Surprising-low-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Surprising low for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Surprising low for what you get</strong></h2><p> As of the time of this writing, you can pick up the DDPAI mini3 for about $130. For what you get out of this camera, we think this is a great value. Similarly-priced models we tested don’t nearly match the quality and utility you get from the mini3.</p><h2 id="Competition-DDPAI-mini3-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-DDPAI-mini3-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition :DDPAI mini3 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition</strong> :<strong>DDPAI</strong> <strong>mini3 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We also tested the mini3 alongside the Z-Edge Z3 Plus, which is a similarly-priced dashcam with more of a focus on security.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and boxy compared to the more stylish form of the mini3. It has an integrated three-inch view screen with physical controls, so you do not have to have a smartphone or tablet to access its most useful features. And although the quality of the picture is excellent, it’s nowhere near as detailed or clear as the mini3’s. But it does have collision detection and a “parking mode” that automatically records motion around your car like a security camera (without the extra hard-wiring kit that the mini3 requires).</p><p> In the end, these two dashcams serve slightly different purposes—if you want a device that’s strictly intended to document what happens to your vehicle as a form of protection, then the Z-Edge model is a good fit. But if you’re a frequent road-tripper who wants some fun extra features for recording your travels, then you’ll probably get a lot of enjoyment out of the mini3.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A surprisingly fun dashboard camera that’s perfect for people who want to share their adventures.</strong></p><p> If you’re a road-tripper, travel vlogger, or plugged-in social media user, then the DDPAI mini3 is made for you. Not only is this dashcam stylish and discreet, it also captures beautiful photos and video of your travels that are perfect for sharing or simply saving to revisit down the road.</p><h3

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Fitness trackers have come a long way over the last few years, and you can find options in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and price ranges. The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is priced in about the mid-range, and it offers a few cool perks in addition to the standards like calorie counting and step counting. I tested the Garmin Vivosmart 4 for a month to see how it performs compared to other similarly priced fitness trackers on the market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band"><a href="#Design-You-can’t-remove-the-band" class="headerlink" title="Design: You can’t remove the band"></a><strong>Design: You can’t remove the band</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart is lightweight, weighing only 16.5 grams (for the small&#x2F;medium size). It has a very slim profile, with the silicone band measuring only about a half of an inch in width. Now, this is great for style purposes, as the band looks great on the wrist. But, the slim design isn’t particularly functional, as the screen is extremely small and somewhat hard to read from a distance (especially if you have poor vision like me). The tiny screen measures a mere 0.26 inches wide by 0.70 inches tall.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has a unibody design, and you cannot remove the tracker portion from the band. I was somewhat disappointed to see that I couldn’t switch out the bands for other colors and styles, especially considering Garmin has such attractive band options. Unfortunately, you can only choose one—grey with rose gold trim, berry with light gold trim, azure blue with silver trim, or the band I tested, black with midnight trim. The band also comes in small&#x2F;medium or large sizes. The small&#x2F;medium size fit my wrist well, but when I had my husband try on the band, it wouldn’t fit around his wrist. Other trackers, like the Fitbit Charge 4, come with both a small and large band.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JsDCEVwOi6EK7WLcs2WJ03jOZb0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-3-ba9d18a527ae4b41a7242ffaccd1de30.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it"><a href="#Comfort-You’ll-forget-you’re-wearing-it" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it"></a><strong>Comfort: You’ll forget you’re wearing it</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 is one of the more comfortable fitness trackers I’ve tested. Most of the time, I’d forget I was even wearing the tracker until it vibrated. The band’s side edges are rounded off, making it feel more comfortable against the skin.</p><p> The buckle doesn’t press into the skin or cause irritation, but the sides of the silicone band do leave indents on the wrist after long periods of wear. The Vivosmart 4 is waterproof, and you can wear it in the pool, wear it while showering, and in the rain without damaging the device. You really only have to take off the Vivosmart to charge the battery.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring"><a href="#Performance-Body-battery-and-stress-monitoring" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring"></a><strong>Performance: Body battery and stress monitoring</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 performs exceptionally well in some areas and mediocre in others, making it a decent device for runners or everyday users who want a device to track their general health and wellness, but a not such great device for fitness buffs who want seamless and accurate workout tracking.</p><p> The Vivosmart 4 has some cool perks, like a pulse ox sensor that can track blood oxygen saturation levels, and a body battery feature that uses a variety of data (oxygen, sleep, heart rate, etc) to determine how much energy you have available. The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend. There’s also a stress monitoring widget you can place right on the tracker’s interface, which I also found incredibly useful. I was in the process of moving while testing the Vivosmart 4, and I could watch my stress levels rising as I went through the stresses of packing, moving, and buying and selling my homes.</p><p> The body battery feature is perhaps the most useful tool within this tracker, as it lets you know when you need to take it easy and when you have more energy available to spend.</p><p> On the downside, the Vivosmart 4’s step counter isn’t exactly accurate, although this tends to be a common problem with fitness trackers. I also saw some issues with the accuracy of the heart rate monitor, as I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor, and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Workout tracking is somewhat lacking in the Vivosmart 4. It has a feature called Move IQ, which is supposed to identify periods of movement that match familiar exercise patterns like walking, running, biking, swimming, or using an elliptical machine. It then automatically starts timing the event for you. This feature is only accurate some of the time though. It detects walking pretty consistently, but it doesn’t do as good of a job at detecting swimming or biking. For strength training, it has a rep counter, but you can also turn on auto-set, and the Vivosmart 4 will attempt to automatically determine when you’re performing a repetitive motion and estimate the number of reps. These features aren’t always accurate though, and you may have to go in and edit the data afterward.</p><p> I tested the heart rate monitor against a chest monitor and it was off by as much as 10 beats per minute.</p><p> Overall, the Garmin Vivosmart 4 is capable of providing an abundance of useful data, but it requires a bit more effort on the part of the user to obtain this information. If you do things like add a custom stride length, edit any activities that didn’t track accurately, track hydration and weight goals, use the female health features, and pair the Garmin Connect app with the My Fitness Pal app, you can get a comprehensive health and fitness tracking experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Fu0WY5D4aslVxU_cls1YqWYQBeg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-2-67ea15321c9541f1b57d5528302152fe.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Software-Garmin-Connect-App"><a href="#Software-Garmin-Connect-App" class="headerlink" title="Software: Garmin Connect App"></a><strong>Software: Garmin Connect App</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 doesn’t have any hard buttons, but rather a monotone touchscreen that you double-tap on the bottom portion to awaken. You scroll up and down to navigate through the various functions. I’m not in love with the interface, which isn’t particularly intuitive or feature-rich. Although companion apps are important to any good fitness tracker, the Vivosmart 4 relies too heavily on its app. It doesn’t have built-in GPS either, so it’s more tethered to your phone than some other fitness trackers on the market.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-connect-course-creator-tool-1683347" >Garmin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Connect app is pretty comprehensive though. You can customize your widgets and choose up to six displayed activities. You can also enable smart notifications, which will send call and text alerts to your Vivosmart 4 or send all notifications. I made the mistake of selecting “all notifications,” and I received, well, all notifications (from my video doorbell, security camera, and shopping apps). I quickly changed the setting to receive notifications for calls and texts only.</p><p> The Garmin Connect app allows you to dive as deep into your fitness tracking as you want. If you’re a runner, it can track everything from your cadence to your max pace. It provides charts and graphs of your long term activity level, heart rate, stress, body battery, and more. You can also use insights to compare that data with the averages in your age and gender category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XmHmMYvuaOGE3gAGIsa_vChmpas=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivosmart-4-Fitness-Tracker-4-22ab906932be467bb2e3309e30555ab4.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days"><a href="#Battery-May-last-a-full-seven-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: May last a full seven days"></a><strong>Battery: May last a full seven days</strong></h2><p> The battery is supposed to last for up to seven days, but the battery life depends largely on the features you use and how frequently you use the tracker. If you’re only passively tracking a few metrics, your battery might last a full week. If you’re constantly checking your heart rate, pulse ox, stress levels, sleep, and counting reps several times a day, your battery will not last that long. I got three and a half days of battery life when taking full advantage of the fitness tracker’s features.</p><p> The battery charges using a clip-on charger. It took an average of 90 minutes to reach a full charge (from about 10% full).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Reasonable"><a href="#Price-Reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable</strong></h2><p> The Vivosmart 4 retails for $130, which is slightly high for this unit.

I also like the body battery and stress monitoring features in the Vivosmart 4. On the other hand, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-charge-3-review-5072527" >Fitbit Charge 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a more accurate heart monitor (according to testing). The Fitbit Charge 3 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTN21JL/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5072535%7Cn5f18362fc97d487e830fd6d6cfaf2af211%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) also offers a ton of workouts in its Fitbit app, and slightly more seamless activity tracking for weight training and high-intensity workouts. If you want a day-to-day fitness tracker to track your sleep, stress, and energy levels, the Vivosmart 4 is a great option. If you want a larger screen and easy tracking for activities like weight training and cycling, you may prefer the Fitbit Charge 3.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A comfortable band with unique perks.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is a great option for anyone who wants to track their sleep, stress, energy, and cardio, but there are better options out there for weight training.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Vivosmart 4</li><li>Product Brand  Garmin</li><li>UPC  010-01995-10</li><li>Price  $130.00</li><li>Weight  4.8 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.38 x 5.75 x 2.95 in.</li><li>Lens material  Polycarbonate</li><li>Bezel material  Aluminum</li><li>Strap material  Silicone</li><li>Display size  0.26 x 0.70 inches</li><li>Resolution  48 x 128 pixels</li><li>Display type  OLED</li><li>Battery life  up to 7 days</li><li>Memory  7 timed activities and 14 days of activity tracking data</li><li>Sensors  heart rate monitor, barometric altimeter, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, pulse ox</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth Smart and ANT+</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android (text response&#x2F;reject phone call with text (Android only)</li><li>Smart features  Smart notifications, connected GPS, weather, and more</li><li>Activity tracking features  Calories burned, floors climbed, and more</li><li>Gym and Fitness  Strength Training, Cardio Training, Elliptical Training, Stair Stepping, Yoga, Automatic Rep Counting</li><li>Other features  training, planning and analysis, heart rate, running, cycling, swimming, kids activity tracking</li><li>What’s included  Vívosmart 4 smart activity tracker, Charging&#x2F;data cable, Manuals</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-tiktok-identity-ultimate-profile-transformation-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering TikTok Identity  Ultimate Profile Transformation Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-vloggers-guide-to-choosing-camera-essentials-the-top-9-accessories/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Vloggers' Guide to Choosing Camera Essentials -

This is a premium quality ultrabook designed to go head to head with the MacBook Air and other ultraportable laptops, but for a lot less money. I put it to the test for 20 hours, evaluating its design, screen quality, performance, battery life, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-beautiful"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-beautiful" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and beautiful"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and beautiful</strong></h2><p> The Surface Laptop Go is certainly a looker. Its solid metal and plastic construction feels both durable and lightweight, and it’s available in Ice Blue, Sandstone, and Platinum. I find Sandstone to be particularly attractive for making the Laptop Go stand out from the crowd. It’s also remarkably thin, and will fit in just about any bag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DZ-_Yk02QL0fYrm0o3TDO7zXv3M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_Surface_Laptop_Go_05-e2623904845848a3841272c93ab139f1.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The keyboard and trackpad really steal the show here, as they are exceptionally high quality for a laptop in this price range. The keyboard is quiet and tactile with soft, almost luxurious keycaps. I was able to write this review on it quite comfortably. The trackpad is one of the best I’ve seen on a laptop of this size. It’s large, easy to use, and compares very well to the top-notch trackpads on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-9370-review-4779836" >Dell XPS 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For navigation, the Surface Laptop Go also has a touchscreen, which I found to be responsive and accurate.</p><p> The audio quality of the built-in speakers in the Surface Laptop Go is remarkably good for such a thin and light device.</p><p> Port selection is rather limited, with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port, a USB-A port, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a Surface Connect port which is used for power but can also be used to connect to a Surface Dock. This is really the bare minimum for I&#x2F;O, and was one of the most frustrating issues for me when using the device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Ideal-for-productivity"><a href="#Display-Ideal-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Display: Ideal for productivity"></a><strong>Display: Ideal for productivity</strong></h2><p> The 12.4-inch display on the Surface Laptop Go seems larger than the size would suggest, thanks to its 3:2 aspect ratio. Because of that aspect ratio, this laptop is purpose-built for productivity. In fact, it was the ideal device for typing out this article. The 1536x1024 resolution is quite sharp, and colors are sharp and accurate with great contrast. Due to the 3:2 aspect ratio, you get black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies and shows, but they still look great due to the quality of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kz6EW4svzivooWEtdVJ5TAnOYOs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_Surface_Laptop_Go_06-07315e6a9862481bba3820f745d49887.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Go"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Speakers-Loud-and-proud"><a href="#Speakers-Loud-and-proud" class="headerlink" title="Speakers: Loud and proud"></a><strong>Speakers: Loud and proud</strong></h2><p> The audio quality of the built-in speakers in the Surface Laptop Go is remarkably good for such a thin and light device. I always play 2Cellos cover of “Thunderstruck” to test the capabilities of speakers and was pleased with how well this laptop performed in the mids and highs.</p><p> Bass was underwhelming, but that’s really to be expected in any laptop, particularly one with this form factor.

It’s only capable of 720p, but it’s not the low resolution itself that really lets it down. Even in decent lighting conditions the video and still images produced by this camera are extremely grainy and low quality so it’s not a great option even for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> meetings.</p><p> The Surface Laptop Go is certainly not the most powerful laptop around, but with 8GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5-1035G1 CPU, and a fast solid-state drive for storage it feels zippy and responsive.</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-power-for-the-price"><a href="#Performance-Decent-power-for-the-price" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent power for the price"></a><strong>Performance: Decent power for the price</strong></h2><p> The Surface Laptop Go is certainly not the most powerful laptop around, but with 8GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5-1035G1 CPU, and a fast solid-state drive for storage it feels zippy and responsive. It’s competent for most productivity tasks, including light photo editing, word processing, and web browsing, essentially filling the same niche as a Chromebook.</p><p> However, due to its lack of a dedicated graphics card, the Laptop Go is no gaming or video editing rig. It achieved a score of 5,378 in GFXBench, which is about what I’d expect from a laptop with these specifications. One issue I did run into is that the Surface Laptop Go does tend to grow rather hot due to the lack of ventilation in its frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dzb-7fUK5xGots6oe-9ZhkMnnTY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_Surface_Laptop_Go_07-3d9500befc3a4b50baf014cc571210a5.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Go"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Another limiting factor is the storage capacity of the Surface Laptop Go. The configuration I tested only had 128GB of space on its solid-state drive, and the maximum configuration only comes with 256GB. You’re not going to be storing a lot of data locally on this machine forcing you to resort to cloud storage most of the time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Modern-hardware"><a href="#Connectivity-Modern-hardware" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Modern hardware"></a><strong>Connectivity: Modern hardware</strong></h2><p> With<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/bluetooth-5-4160255" >Bluetooth 5.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Surface Laptop Go is equipped with a competent range of communications capabilities.

It’ll comfortably fill out a workday or last for a long plane flight.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R8WVIj9pTzxwTOIwiZpDPRc6Bws=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_Surface_Laptop_Go_03-d503f456e6df4db4a3ad76a6a9a49e72.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Go"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-A-decision-to-make"><a href="#Software-A-decision-to-make" class="headerlink" title="Software: A decision to make"></a><strong>Software: A decision to make</strong></h2><p> The Surface Laptop Go ships with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-10-s-4173113#:~:text=Windows%2010%20in%20S%20mode%20can%20only%20run%20Windows%20apps,and%20potentially%20longer%20battery%20life." >S mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that the device gains an extra degree of security, but also that it’s limited to apps available in the Windows Store. However, you can take the computer out of S mode to use a fully-functional version of Windows 10. However, think carefully before doing so because there’s no going back.</p><p> The 12.4-inch display on the Surface Laptop Go seems larger than the size would suggest, thanks to its 3:2 aspect ratio.</p><p> In terms of bloatware, the laptop came with a few pre-installed apps: a Microsoft Office trial, Adobe Photoshop Express, and a few other odds and ends. However, it’s all easily removed if you so choose, and doesn’t really get in the way.</p><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-Value"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-Value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable Value"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable Value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $549, the Surface Laptop Go offers high-end build quality at a mid-range price point.

Of course, that price might be higher depending upon the configuration you go with.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_QEntMJEPlaXArgv2l576Qnr7MU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_Surface_Laptop_Go_04-21f4f7c4d0f54436bb1449bf36a42460.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-Go-vs-HP-Pavilion-14-HD"><a href="#Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-Go-vs-HP-Pavilion-14-HD" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Surface Laptop Go vs. HP Pavilion 14 HD"></a><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop Go vs. HP Pavilion 14 HD</strong></h2><p> If you need more ports and storage, you might consider the HP Pavilion 14 HD, which also has a larger 14-inch display with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

The downside of this arrangement is that they usually charge you a monthly equipment rental fee which might seem small on paper but adds up over time. The Motorola MG7700 is a modem and router combo that can put your ISP’s unit to shame with four gigabit-capable LAN ports, dual-band Wi-Fi, and user-friendly setup.</p><p> We recently reviewed the MG7700 to examine just how well it would perform in an average home environment by evaluating the design, ease of setup, network speeds, and software features.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

On the front of the device, you’ll find several indicator lights that tell you if it’s powered up, whether any traffic is flowing through your network, and if people are connected to your wireless network. The light indicators are easy to see and understand — something you don’t typically find in a modem from your cable company.</p><p> The MG7700 has a power port on the back, as well as a coaxial port for connecting your service provider’s cable to the device. There are also four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071" >local area network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (LAN) ports if you want to directly plug your computers and other devices into the modem using an Ethernet cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/djrbmUe-WrBQ_Tx-xD6258JjBmU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-4-5c8faefcc9e77c0001a926be.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> Oddly, there’s a black area between the power port and the top LAN port that has nothing in it, as if there are LAN ports missing. With more devices like smart home hubs requiring you to plug in with Ethernet, it would have been nice to see a few more LAN ports on the back.</p><p> One thing you’ll want to keep in mind that the modem’s stand makes the nine-inch box best suited for vertical placement. You can still place it on the side but it makes for a rather untidy appearance.</p><p> The Best Cable Modems on the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Location-location-location"><a href="#Setup-Process-Location-location-location" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Location, location, location"></a>Setup Process: Location, location, location</h2><p> Since the Motorola MG7700 is a combined cable modem and router, you’ll need to plug it into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-network-cables-817868" >your ISP’s coaxial cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to pipe Internet into your home. This can limit your placement locations a bit since coax cables are often installed by your provider in less-than-ideal locations, especially if you live in an apartment building.</p><p> The router offered a strong Wi-Fi signal on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands on both floors of our home.</p><p> If you do get the choice of where it’s installed, you usually want the coax cable to come in from an unobtrusive corner, not sprouting out from the middle of the living room in an unsightly fashion. Unfortunately, that’s bad for routers which work best in a central location of your house or apartment so the signal covers everywhere you need. If you can’t get find a good spot away from other wireless devices, metal, walls, and other barriers that can impede signal, you may want to invest in a coax cable extension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RfuGGYo_UZvzWOQw8Rb7KZnMkhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-1-5c8faf2dc9e77c00014a9db2.jpg"                      alt="Motorola 7700"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> A last but vital thing to know: Motorola’s branding for the device makes clear that it’s designed for Comcast Xfinity, Cox, and Spectrum. If you don’t use one of those ISP carriers, your modem won’t work on the network.</p><p> Information about approved third-party equipment can usually be found on your cable provider’s website. If not, it’s best to call and ask before you buy. We were able to set it up on Spectrum without any trouble.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-The-latest-standards"><a href="#Connectivity-The-latest-standards" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: The latest standards"></a>Connectivity: The latest standards</h2><p> The Motorola MG7700 is a 24x8 DOCSIS 3.0 modem that doubles as a wireless router. It has 24 downstream channels (which are lanes that handle network traffic, so the more, the better) allowing it to potentially hit a 1 Gbps download speed. There are eight upstream channels for a maximum 246 Mbps upload. This is a pretty standard set of connectivity protocols that makes it a lot faster than 16x4 modems, but slower than 32x8 ones.</p><p> And while actual speeds will depend heavily on what your cable provider offers, we tested the modem on Spectrum’s 100 Mbps plan, so although the MG7700 may be advertised to be capable of 1 Gbps download, we never actually hit it. In fact, Motorola cautions that the device is realistically recommended for actual downstream service of 650 Mbps. But since relatively few people are taking advantage of gigabit Internet today (unless you’re gaming, probably), the 24x8 should serve fine for the vast majority of users.</p><p> We found that it delivered outstanding speeds, maxing out our 100Mbps Spectrum plan when hard-wired via the LAN ports.</p><p> As for the router, it’s AC1900. The “AC” means it has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support, allowing it to beam wireless signals over two frequencies: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. The 2.4GHz band is slower but has a longer range, while the 5GHz band is faster and less prone to interference from other wireless devices compared with the 2.4GHz band, but this comes at the cost of shorter range. These days, most devices support dual-band Wi-Fi and you can select which band you want to connect to.</p><p> Some advice: It’s often best to connect things such as smart switches and smart bulbs to the 2.4GHz band since they tend to be scattered across the house and reserve the 5GHz one for more bandwidth-hungry devices such as streaming sticks, game consoles, and TVs.</p><p> The “1900” represents the maximum theoretical bandwidth the router is capable of. In this case, the MG7700 could hit 1,900 Mbps, but again, this is only if your cable provider supports it, not to mention other factors like wireless interference due to congested bands and throttling from your provider.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-with-a-caveat"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-with-a-caveat" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast speeds with a caveat"></a>Network Performance: Fast speeds with a caveat</h2><p> Once we got the modem up and running, it delivered outstanding speeds, reliably maxing out our 100 Mbps Spectrum plan when we were hard-wired via the LAN ports.</p><p> When we went wireless, performance varied greatly. As mentioned before, you’ll want to try to place the modem in an area where you can reach the greatest number of devices around your home. But, if like us, you were forced to put the router in an area that isn’t ideal because of coax cable limitations, your wireless signal won’t go as far as you might like.</p><p> Overall, if you live in a large apartment or a modestly-sized home, you won’t be disappointed by the performance of the MG7700.</p><p> We tested the Motorola MG7700 in our 4,500-square-foot home while connected to a couple dozen devices (tablets, gaming consoles, computers, smartphones, etc.). The router offered a strong Wi-Fi signal on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands on both floors of our home. Everything from surfing the Web to streaming video was solid within an approximate 2,000-square-foot radius. In the basement and more distant locations of the house, the signal was weak, but that’s to be expected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pHbG256tJv_ubRtv-HdKUka66IA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-3-5c8fb059c9e77c0001a926bf.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> If you have a large home like us and need stronger, more reliable speeds for numerous devices, some routers come with tri-band instead of the dual-band technology you’ll find in the MG7700. These routers have an extra 5GHz band which translates to faster speeds, more bandwidth, and the ability to connect more devices at the same time. You can also purchase a Wi-Fi extender, so your signal can extend and reach all the dead areas, but those are sometimes finicky to set up.</p><p> Overall, if you live in a large apartment or a modestly-sized home, you won’t be disappointed by the performance of the MG7700.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-User-friendly-options"><a href="#Software-User-friendly-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: User-friendly options"></a>Software: User-friendly options</h2><p> The MG7700’s built-in software is customizable, too. Once your router is set up, you can go to a specified IP address (the instructions will tell you which one) in your Web browser to change settings, including the name of the default network, enabling password protection, toggling the channels your router will communicate on, and more.

Thankfully, both options support<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video playback.

Each has dedicated volume and playback controls and multi-function directional buttons that run on AAA batteries. Both remotes also include quick access buttons that let you quickly switch between streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ (these options vary).</p><p> Each streaming stick uses a separate micro-USB adapter for power and can be connected to either a wall outlet or directly to your TV for power.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cable-vs-streaming-5082949" >Cable vs. Streaming: What’s the Difference? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p> Both options include built-in Wi-Fi, meaning they don’t need to be hard-wired for anything to work, just an active wireless connection in your home. While they both include voice search, the Fire TV Stick 4K is slightly more responsive. It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support, making it just a dash of added functionality, especially if you’re already an owner of any of Amazon’s smart hubs.</p><p> Both remotes can also substitute for your handy TV remote. The baked-in Bluetooth connectivity for each device effectively replaces the 3.5mm audio jack in some previous versions, allowing you to wirelessly pair headphones and listen to the TV without disturbing others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fDygh71SKXWa7GJhGDgx-gXLQaw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/febbf2d3-010f-41d3-828f-2a038d0532be_1.36688055a9b3d6cca8cdd8adc2881437-b88a0309e7c5405d93ba58e6cd2aca8d.jpeg"                      alt="Roku Stick"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Mobile apps are available for both devices but drastically differ in their approach. The Roku app is easily the more impressive of the two, serving as an ad-hoc remote if your original happens to go missing and allowing you to quickly search for apps and media using your phone’s keyboard.</p><p> The Fires TV Stick app offers the primary home, menu, and back buttons, allowing you to perform a quick voice search, but it lacks the private listening feature offered on Roku.</p><p> The Fire TV Stick does have an additional barrier to set up, requiring an Amazon account before you’re up and running. While it isn’t needed, the Fire Stick does its best to nudge you towards an Amazon Prime subscription if you don’t already have one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Channels-Apps"><a href="#Channels-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Channels &#x2F; Apps"></a>Channels &#x2F; Apps</h2><p> While all the most popular streaming services are available on both devices, there are differences. Some estimates say the Roku has nearly 10,000 more apps than Amazon’s streaming stick.</p><p> The bottom line here is unless you’re looking for a very particular game or app, it’s most likely available on either device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Verdict-Roku-Takes-the-Prize"><a href="#Final-Verdict-Roku-Takes-the-Prize" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict: Roku Takes the Prize"></a>Final Verdict: Roku Takes the Prize</h2><p> Both players are the same price, $50, so choosing one should depend on what you expect from your streaming device in terms of available apps and channels.</p><p> The answer is evident if you’re already living in the Amazon ecosystem: the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k/dp/B0BP9MDCQZ?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5088017%7Cnb2692bccb8df4ddea9f223f2254526e412%7C" >Buy on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> However, the Roku platform hosts a more extensive library of apps and channels.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 is designed to deliver high-performance features in a low-budget package; this model has a great range and a high-intensity LED display. Let’s take a closer look at some strengths and weaknesses to evaluate what kind of performance you can expect on the road.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-bit-cheap"><a href="#Design-A-bit-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A bit cheap"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>A bit cheap</strong></h2><p> The S55 is palm-sized, about comparable in size and shape to most other radar detectors. The plastic material feels a bit cheaper than other radar detectors I’ve tested, though the control buttons worked well and felt long-lasting and I never had issues with them sticking. The Passport S55 comes with a very small windshield mount that’s functional, but you may want to consider an aftermarket mount. It’s minimal with small suction cups and I’m not confident it will last long. Luckily, the lightweight design of the S55 means it doesn’t need much to hold it in place.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display shows bright red text&#x2F;symbols for maximum visibility while driving. The S55 can show four signal strength meters at the same time, plus the numeric frequency of alerts. There’s also a dark mode that turns off the display but doesn’t disable the audio alert.</p><p> The speaker on this radar detector is very small, about a quarter-inch square, but the audio alerts are high volume. You can select between standard and loud tones. The SmartCord power cable for the S55 has a handy mute button on it so you don’t have to reach over the dash.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-installation"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-installation" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy installation"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy installation</strong></h2><p> The S55 is straightforward and easy to install. Simply stick the windshield mount in place and plug the SmartCord lighter adapter into your car’s DC cigarette lighter input. Plugging the modular jack into the S55 will automatically power on the radar detector and you can quickly customize settings for display brightness, detector sensitivity levels, and volume. Then you’re ready to hit the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Impressive-detection"><a href="#Range-Impressive-detection" class="headerlink" title="Range: Impressive detection"></a><strong>Range: Impressive detection</strong></h2><p> The Passport S55 features Enhanced Radar Protection that delivers long-distance range for laser and radar bands, including K and Ka bands, widely used microwave frequencies for police radar guns. It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity. While testing the S55 in Highway mode I received Ka-band alerts over a mile and a half out from where I approached a highway patrol parked on the median of the interstate. This range was on par with much more expensive models.</p><p> It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced"><a href="#Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Not exactly enhanced"></a><strong>Performance: Not exactly enhanced</strong></h2><p> The S55 has different modes designed to adjust to specific frequency bands and sensitivity levels for city or highway driving. You can quickly customize the settings by using the included quick reference guide. You can also turn off specific frequency bands if they tend to give a lot of false alerts.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><p> In terms of false alerts, the AutoSensitivity feature didn’t really help in directing the overall high-sensitivity. This radar detector gave frequent false alerts from commercial door-openers and vehicle anti-collision warning systems. Unfortunately, the S55 lacks the advanced filters of more expensive models that help reduce the annoying frequency of false alerts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4737285&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/b2f83c409ce63012229fb9cd465bdcfe/products/copy_reporting_system.png"                      border="0"                >  KoolReport Pro  is an advanced solution for creating data reports and dashboards in PHP.

More advanced radar detectors can easily be several hundred dollars more expensive, and the S55 is a good deal if you plan to use it primarily on the highway. Door-openers along the city and commercial roads will frequently trigger false alerts.

The Uniden DFR9 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniden-DFR9-Detection-Cameras-Display/dp/B07F6PZXHM/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799949%7Cncd245a3f879640b69fbbb5e95c20e78e20%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a model that can be considered the next price tier above the S55. The DFR9’s MSRP is $300 but it can often be found on sale for about $270.</p><p> The DFR9 has an excellent detection range and a color LED display. The DFR9 also features GPS technology that filters out stationary false alerts, a welcome addition in mid-level radar detectors, and supports database access which alerts you to red light and speed camera locations.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A basic radar detector that’s ideal for beginners or anyone on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 has reliable long-range detection, but I found its performance and range of features to be pretty basic. This unit never missed the presence of parked police down the highway who appeared to be using radar guns, which means I’m confident in recommending this model for those on a budget. However, buyer beware that false alerts are an unavoidable inconvenience with this model.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

Google’s mesh router takes all of these tenets and runs with them, resulting in the Google Wifi, a wireless<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that not only performs with the best of them but is affordable and stylish enough to carve out a place in anyone’s home. Paired with the approachable Google Wifi app, you can easily set it up and forget about it, instead focusing on all you want to do online.</p><p> We spent a long time using Google Wifi in our apartment evaluating its design, ease of setup, connectivity, and software.</p><h2 id="Design-Elegance-in-function"><a href="#Design-Elegance-in-function" class="headerlink" title="Design: Elegance in function"></a><strong>Design: Elegance in function</strong></h2><p> One of the first things that jump out when you pull the Google Wifi out of the box for the first time is its elegance. In the past, you’d be stuck with these ugly wireless routers with antennas sticking out in four different directions. They were unsightly beasts which encouraged people to hide them behind decor, weakening the signal.</p><p> The Google Wifi, with its simple white design and a singular color-coded light band, is incredibly unobtrusive by contrast. In fact, it’s one of the rare wireless routers you may want to display prominently, which will make setting the Google Wifi in the perfect spot a breeze.</p><p> The Google Wifi might just be one of the best wireless routers on the market, and it’s hard to think of someone we wouldn’t recommend it to.</p><h2 id="Setup-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> We’ve set up dozens of wireless networks in our time, and it is impossible to overstate how awesome the Google Wifi’s setup process is. Understanding that most people don’t want to dig through arcane instructions in order to browse the web, Google makes setup a breeze.</p><p> You can use any of the three Wifi nodes as the core unit that connects to your modem, so you don’t have to figure out which one is the most special. Then, you just need to download the Google Wifi app on either the Google Play Store or the App Store on iOS. After that, it’s just a matter of scanning the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> located on each unit, placing, and labeling them. That’s it, it’s that easy.</p><p> Even with our 250Mbps Xfinity service, setup was a breeze, right out of the box. And, once you have all of the Wifi points connected you can manage your Wifi network through the Google Wifi app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qytl4iFlphzC_PEngQcnmNQ08nU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4139748-3-5c91043c46e0fb0001770142.jpg"                      alt="Google Wifi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rui Yang</p><h2 id="Software-Network-admin-for-everyone"><a href="#Software-Network-admin-for-everyone" class="headerlink" title="Software: Network admin for everyone"></a><strong>Software: Network admin for everyone</strong></h2><p> One thing that typically holds people back from really taking control over their networks is software. Having to dig through_ipconfig_ to find your network gateway, typing that into your web browser, then having to deal with the complicated backend isn’t our idea of a good time. But, that’s why the Google Wifi app is so noteworthy.</p><p> All network admin tasks can be performed through the app, and it’s all laid out in an extraordinarily simple way. A couple of simple taps allow you to set up a guest Wi-Fi network, manage family controls or see if any of your nodes are down.</p><p> The Google Wifi app even has a built-in network check that will not just test the speed of your network, it’ll check all of your mesh units. This can help you identify problem areas in your mesh network. If one of your Google Wifi nodes is getting less than ideal signal, you can just move that node to a more signal-friendly area in your home.</p><p> There are a couple more advanced functions that the Google Wifi generally handles automatically, so less advanced users don’t need to worry about being alienated by little white cylinders—even if more experienced network admins might be left wanting for finer controls.</p><p> Take a look at other product reviews and shop for the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mesh-wi-fi-network-systems-4139748" >best mesh wifi network systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9S7E-N_VashUpOWO5ZRp4ig5Fmw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4139748-1-5c9104a7c9e77c0001e11e05.jpg"                      alt="Google Wifi"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rui Yang</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Limited-but-modern"><a href="#Connectivity-Limited-but-modern" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Limited, but modern"></a><strong>Connectivity: Limited, but modern</strong></h2><p> This lack of fine-tuned controls carries over to the Google Wifi’s general connectivity: it’s a bit sparse, at least as far as ports are concerned. Each node has two Gigabit Ethernet ports and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , used for power. This does mean that you can have<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071" >LAN connections <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in several parts of your home, but if you need several LAN ports in one room, you’ll be left wanting.</p><p> Fortunately, you can absolutely get by with just the wireless capabilities. This is a tri-band router, with each of the nodes communicating on their own bandwidth, so your gaming won’t get interrupted by someone else streaming or browsing.</p><p> When it comes to specs, the AC1200 Wave 2 capabilities are impressive enough, but when you add the quad-core ARM processor that intelligently directs the signal to devices that need it the most, you have the recipe for fantastic performance throughout your home or office.</p><p> For instance, if you have several Google Wifi points set up throughout your home, you can walk around your house watching a YouTube video on your iPad, and Google Wifi will automatically shift to provide a wireless signal from whichever node is closest. You’ll never be interrupted and you don’t need to do anything manually, everything happens automatically behind the scenes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-performance-Unrivaled-reliability"><a href="#Network-performance-Unrivaled-reliability" class="headerlink" title="Network performance: Unrivaled reliability"></a><strong>Network performance: Unrivaled reliability</strong></h2><p> We’ve been using the Google Wifi for about six months at the time of this writing, and we’re not exaggerating when we say we haven’t run into a single problem with dropped connections or slowdown in our time using this router. There were a couple of times a single node went down, but thanks to the color-coded LEDs, we were able to tell right away. And, that’s basically the crux of what the Google Wifi provides: unrivaled reliability.</p><p> It’s not_just_ reliable, though, it’s also fast. Google advertises a 4,500-foot range for the 3-pack we tested. In confines of our home, we were consistently getting more than 250Mbps wherever we went. In fact, in order to experience slower speeds, we had to walk outside to the middle of the cul de sac we live on, and even then we were still getting more than 100 Mbps. If you’re clever and place your Wifi points within sight of each other, you can have fast internet everywhere in your home.</p><p> And, that’s basically the crux of what the Google Wifi provides: unrivaled reliability.</p><p> But life doesn’t simply revolve around download speeds, especially in households with multiple people. The best routers need to be able to handle the heavy load from multiple devices at the same time.</p><p> The Google Wifi kills it here as well. During our testing, we had two people streaming Netflix in 4K, while a roommate played online games in another room uninterrupted.</p><p> Google Wifi doesn’t support MU-MIMO, (or Multi-user, multiple input, multiple output,) but due to the nature of the mesh network, it almost doesn’t matter. Unless you’re doing heavy networking over a wireless connection, Google Wifi is going to be more than fast enough for everyday workloads. Which is all we can ask for in a router marketed to the average user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Ahead-of-the-curve"><a href="#Price-Ahead-of-the-curve" class="headerlink" title="Price: Ahead of the curve"></a><strong>Price: Ahead of the curve</strong></h2><p> Google Wifi starts at $129 for a single Wifi point, which is perfect for most apartments. If you have a larger home, and you need the added coverage, you’re looking at $299. That might sound like a lot of money, especially if you’ve been using the router built into your cable modem for a while, but trust us, it’s worth the cash. Compared to most other mesh routers, Google Wifi provides tons of performance and more individual nodes. This means that you can cover a greater area for less. And, with a performance this good, we can’t complain.</p><p> Compared to most other mesh routers, Google Wifi provides tons of performance and more individual nodes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Wifi-vs-Netgear-Orbi"><a href="#Google-Wifi-vs-Netgear-Orbi" class="headerlink" title="Google Wifi vs. Netgear Orbi"></a><strong>Google Wifi vs. Netgear Orbi</strong></h2><p> The Google Wifi doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and the Netgear Orbi may be the closest to claiming Google’s crown over the mesh Wi-Fi kingdom. The Netgear Orbi comes with one router and one satellite, as opposed to the Google Wifi’s three nodes, and will set you back about $320.</p><p> Don’t be fooled into thinking that Netgear is criminally overcharging here though—these two units can theoretically provide more coverage: 5,000 feet, as opposed to the Google Wifi’s 4,500 feet. Google’s setup and maintenance are easier to get into, but experienced network admins will prefer the greater control that Netgear affords them. Overall, it all boils down to budget and accessibility—the Google Wifi is easier to use and to afford, but the Netgear Orbi is more powerful.</p><p> See our other reviews of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >best wireless routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An excellent router for almost everyone.</strong></p><p> The Google Wifi might just be one of the best wireless routers on the market, and it’s hard to think of someone we wouldn’t recommend it to. It’s easy to set up, has stellar performance and reliability, and it looks good to boot. It’s not quite as versatile as some other routers out there, but most users will likely see that as a feature. If you don’t want to fiddle around with an obtuse settings menu, and want something that you can just plug in and be ready to browse, you really can’t go wrong with the Google Wifi.</p><!-- affiliate

Yakuza: Like a Dragon takes the standard Yakuza formula and stands it on its head, moving the fighting system from real-time to turn-based and making this entry to the series feel like a true JRPG. I played Yakuza: Like a Dragon<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-pc-games-4147292" >on PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find out if these changes make this game better or worse.

Kasuga gets into a bit of trouble with a Yakuza family but is saved by Masumi Arakawa, the patriarch of the Arakawa family. Because of this, Kasuga pledges his life to Arakawa, promising to repay the debt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Mo4mMH944CddmYJTyCxtMRxK9-k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_05-e59c99ba9bd249e7a2241f532dd742dc.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> A few years later, Kasuga is asked to confess to a murder that was really committed by one of the Captains in the family. Kasuga spends 18 years in prison for the crime, which brings us to modern day. Once out of prison, Kasuga finds he no longer has a place in the family due to some serious changes that have taken place while he was away. Kasuga is shot and left for dead in the Yokohama area of Isezaki Ijincho. From there, the game opens up as you try to rebuild everything that was lost and find out what happened.</p><p> All of the aforementioned story takes place in what could be called the introductory stages of the game. The intro was incredibly slow and took around five to six hours. Finally, after the long intro, it felt like I was getting into the real meat where the world opens up. Even after the long preamble, I was still introduced to new items, concepts, and parts of the game. It felt like a lot of handholding, which was frustrating at times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_ksFqEWrm3B3MbfrBujuNtLpcXw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_03-37ca82f2a4cd42c4ad65f34e2ca63b68.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> Once things open up, the story gets going in what can only be described as a true modern-day JRPG. It has many of the common tropes of a JRPG, like a party system that allows you to manage those who fight with you, turn-based combat, and a long sweeping epic filled with plenty of side quests.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting, and deep and interesting characters.</p><p> Yakuza: Like a Dragon is clearly inspired by games like Dragon Quest. So much so that eventually, and in a truly hilarious fashion, Kasuga begins having delusions of being a hero, and makes it his life’s mission to become a hero who can save everyone around him. These delusions play out in a physical change that takes place over enemies during combat. Their eyes turn red, and their bodies change, but Kasuga is the only one who can see these changes.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting and deep and interesting characters. There are plenty of opportunities to get to know the people who travel with you, and you come to care about the characters and their motivations. Yakuza: Like a Dragon is story-rich, and you won’t be disappointed at the amount of content to explore.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times"></a>Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times</h2><p> Gameplay in Yakuza: Like a Dragon feels incredibly polished. World exploration feels intuitive—you can run from point to point, stopping for distractions along the way, and sometimes engage in a conversation with your party during travel. Yokohama feels alive and real. There are billboards, stores, and people everywhere. You have to be careful when crossing the street, as you can suddenly get hit by a car, which seems to happen more than it should.</p><p> The map is easy to use, and there is a taxi fast-travel system. As you explore, you will find some areas off-limits, but you’ll also find some areas where your level is not high enough to access. For the most part, though, running into enemies is really fun since it throws you into combat.</p><p> The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny.</p><p> Combat is handled with a turn-based system. During the fight, you have a menu of different selections, from regular attacks and items to defending and special attacks. This is where Yakuza: Like a Dragon really shines. The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny. For instance, you can have a homeless teammate attack with a flock of pigeons, or maybe have your bartender attack with moves from her boxing fitness class.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZvcwNcecc79umImvw53CUJlLvIc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_02-6396bcd8866c4a479331a02e160eb890.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The moves are creative and fun to use. After selecting the attack, timed button presses may increase the attack’s effectiveness or provide you with bonus damage. When you need a true power attack, you can use your phone to call PoundMates, which is a special “Summoning” move that calls in an ally to do massive damage. There are tons of PoundMates in the game, from a diaper-wearing adult man to a poisonous lobster named Nancy, and calling these special attacks is part of what makes Yakuza fun to play.</p><p> You should be able to finish the main story in around 45 to 55 hours, depending on how fast you run through it, but I highly recommend taking your time and enjoying all the wonderful diversions available.</p><p> There’s a job system, which will let you change the different abilities of your team. This lets you customize your party to fill different roles, like healer or tank. However, in Yakuza, you’ll find some rather interesting jobs. There’s gear as well, but this is pretty standard fare. You’ll encounter a ton of diversions and side quests. Some of the minigames are innovative and comical, but some are also very benign.</p><p> This<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pc-gaming-reviews-4689600" >PC game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> plays just like it should, and the controls are top-notch. Everything just works, which is a rare feat these days. You should be able to finish the main story in around 45 to 55 hours, depending on how fast you run through it, but I highly recommend taking your time and enjoying all the wonderful diversions available.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Excellent-visuals"><a href="#Graphics-Excellent-visuals" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Excellent visuals"></a>Graphics: Excellent visuals</h2><p> The graphics and visuals are impressive.

The whole game has a very modern feel but also has so many nods to its JRPG roots.

The price is reasonable for the amount of gameplay. However, you have two other purchase options as well.

Both games feature turn-based combat, jobs working as roles, and a large sweeping and epic tale. Yakuza: Like a Dragon diverges in one major way, and that is not being afraid to innovate and push the limits of what a JRPG can be. Where Dragon Quest is the basic formula, Yakuza: Like a Dragon is what happens when a mad scientist gets a hold of that formula and creates something both crazy and brilliant.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An entertaining and addictive JRPG.</strong></p><p> A well-crafted masterpiece. Yakuza: Like a Dragon falls into the must-play category for anyone who loves a good story, JRPGs, or a wild game that will make you laugh. It’s definitely a departure from the rest of the series, but that contributes to a lot of the fun and uniqueness of the game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cyberpunk-2077-review-5113844" >Cyberpunk 2077 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/godfall-review-5095668" >Godfall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/torment-tides-of-numenera-review-5077302" >Torment: Tides of Numenera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Yakuza: Like a Dragon</li><li>Product Brand  SEGA</li><li>SKU  6413107</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  4.1 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  0.6 x 5.4 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Color  N&#x2F;A</li><li>Rating  Mature 17+</li><li>Platform  Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discover-the-genesis-advanced-reverse-lookup-on-instagram-photos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discover the Genesis  Advanced Reverse Lookup on Instagram Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-resolving-the-disappearance-of-shorts-thumbnails/"><u>[New] In 2024, Resolving the Disappearance of Shorts Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-online-add-on-social-media-story-vault/"><u>[New] Online Add-On  Social Media Story Vault</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-social-savvy-essential-hashtags-that-work-today/"><u>[New] Social Savvy  Essential Hashtags That Work Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-banish-coffee-stains-free-iphone-app-to-remove-red-eyes-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Banish Coffee Stains  Free iPhone App to Remove Red Eyes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-bypassing-detection-for-instagram-story-insights-pcandroidios/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Bypassing Detection for Instagram Story Insights -

The game begins with the character you’ll play as waking up in a panic. Someone will narrate everything that’s going on to you, including what the area around you looks like. After a short introduction, you’ll be prompted to pick what you want to play as: Glaive, Jack, or Nano. These will roughly translate into someone more physical, someone mixed physical and magical, and a mage, but of course, set in this strange half-fantastical, half-science-fiction world where everything is new and unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/b1_d8ikgtdkSH_Y0F510q_BXpK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-03-d99b43959fa74b31a15f336852f14d75.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> This whole introduction is slow moving and boring, and getting through it is rough. But even past this, things don’t necessarily pick up and get more interesting. The game has such a heavy hand with its narration, telling you the game’s visuals even though you can see them right there on your screen. The whole game reads like someone wrote a novel, couldn’t publish it, and then decided making a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was a better idea, and instead of trimming the fat, they left every unnecessary description and detail in the game’s prompt.</p><p> I did continue forward, even though I was already disinterested, hoping the game would become more gripping. After the memory room, you’ll wake to another platform where a being tells you you’ve suffered a great injury and they are in your mind. He tries to explain who you are but before he gets too far, you’ll be attacked by something called the Sorrow. Eventually, you’ll wake in the real world, enter the game’s main city, and be able to talk to the wealth of characters living there. You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><p> You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort"><a href="#Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort"></a><strong>Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort</strong></h2><p> The Tides of Numenera is a third-person<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-offline-rpg-games-4177675" >role-playing game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where almost 75 percent of the gameplay is scrolling dialogue boxes and the various prompts that will pop up as the game tells you the story. These prompts will allow you control over how the story unfolds, and this, more than anything else, is the game’s main mechanic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8H4QhkgilcsrFlNL40KO1tDnKvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-02-cca6ebdc67d6477ab973b796fb7e773c.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> Beyond this, the other major gameplay mechanic is a system of effort and inspiration. Every action you take will prompt you to use effort. This effort allows for your character to work harder at the chosen action, and thus gives your character a better chance of accomplishing their goal.</p><p> This system is set in place in an attempt to allow you some control over which tasks you want to prioritize with effort―but understand that a lot of the game is built around failure. The game even tells you as much in the introduction. Failing doesn’t mean you’ve messed up, it just means you’ll be set on a different course of the game’s story. Really, I never felt this mechanic offered more than giving players a false sense of control. In reality, the effort prompts didn’t feel like they added much to the overall gameplay experience, they certainly didn’t add any much needed excitement.</p><p> Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> The inspiration aspect is probably the game’s most interesting gameplay mechanic. While you are exploring the world and speaking to characters, you’ll sway them depending on the various prompts. This alignment system will affect the story and what prompts become available for your character. Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> Overall, this game was a weak attempt at offering players the experience of a novel in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> format. The storytelling is very heavy-handed. The writing is weak and full of repeated telling of things you can easily see on-screen around you. There’s little to no direction about where to go or what exactly you should be doing, and combined with the long paragraphs of text, things becomes boring fast. The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way. It’s just a shame that it gets buried under such heavy, inactive storytelling.</p><p> The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated and simplistic"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated and simplistic</strong></h2><p> Tides of Numenera was created in 2017―however, you wouldn’t know this if you jumped into the game and made a guess based upon the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optimizing-video-game-frame-rates-811784" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The graphics look more like they’re stuck in the early 2000s, with blocky, almost pixelated characters. There is some forgiveness to be had because the game isn’t focused on the visuals―it’s more about the words and the story. But there is a limit to how forgiving one can be considering the game isn’t that old.</p><p> The one positive is the originality in the world the developers have created. The setting feels unique―a mix of strange alien tech within a fantasy city. A wide range of characters will fill the game, and they respond and react in creative ways. It’s also a fun experience to run around and talk to these various characters and explore the game’s world and the lore of Numenera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DfXjCwwtXMVBL58JZmix5sR3vBQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-04-7f9c8617b9cd41738ad2ac02abf0aec9.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story"><a href="#Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story" class="headerlink" title="Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story"></a><strong>Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story</strong></h2><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is still an expensive game, costing $50 on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-steam-games-4176308" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it’s not on sale.

Wasteland 2 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Wasteland-2-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-4/dp/B013CQHQFU/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a very similar game, as it is made by the same developers, but where Numenera falls flat with its heavy-handed storytelling, Wasteland 2 stands apart with a fun, tactical combat system.</p><p> Another third-person RPG that will have a great and well-developed world to explore is Pillars of Eternity (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Pillars-Eternity-Complete-PlayStation-4/dp/B0734T77S2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). The game will allow you to explore a rich fantasy world and its huge dungeon, and while still rich in story, won’t bog you down to the point of boredom. The last game I’ll recommend looking at is any of the Mass Effect titles. Mass Effect does a great job of building a rich science-fiction world while also giving the player a story filled story-altering choices and decisions.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A text-heavy RPG that doesn’t live up to its predecessor.</strong></p><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is a role-playing game focused on creating an experience that is more novel than video game. The storytelling is text heavy, but the world is rich and unique, mixing sci-fi and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the unique world wasn’t enough to carry me through the outdated graphics and boring gameplay.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Whether you are a walker, runner, swimmer, cyclist, or a general health enthusiast, the Fitbit Inspire HR provides all the key insights you need to stay active and at the top of your game. It features the calorie- and step-counting functions that<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-fitbit-4176010" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is known for, and as a new feature, the Fitbit Inspire HR includes 24&#x2F;7 heart rate tracking, which can help you assess your progress throughout training by charting your heart rate, workouts, and sleep quality.</p><p> We recently put the Inspire HR to the test to evaluate how the inclusion of heart rate functions augments Fitbit’s core wellness model. We wore the Inspire HR continually for a week of daily training runs, day-to-day activities, and while sleeping to get a picture of how the fitness tracker can provide valuable perspectives for any training goal while remaining a budget-oriented fitness tracker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EVe-neqYdJ7lSX6koaCLTE-Ce7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4057119-03-e8135fa8ae7a4844b3c42b45731c6a35.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Inspire HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Design-Low-profile-comfortable-and-intuitive"><a href="#Design-Low-profile-comfortable-and-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Design: Low-profile, comfortable, and intuitive"></a><strong>Design: Low-profile, comfortable, and intuitive</strong></h2><p> No one wants to feel weighed down by a clunky fitness watch, and Fitbit has designed the Inspire HR to be super light and agile at only 0.64 ounces. It comes standard with two wristbands, one small and one large, measuring five inches and 6.25 inches long, respectively. The wristbands are a little over a half an inch wide and are made of a soft polymer material, making the Inspire HR very comfortable to wear to bed if you want to take advantage of the sleep monitoring capabilities.</p><p> The unit feels more like a bracelet than a watch—it’s so light and unobtrusive that you can easily forget you’re wearing it. And for a device that aims to deliver around-the-clock health data, this is a big advantage.</p><p> The unit feels more like a bracelet than a watch—it’s so light and unobtrusive that you can easily forget you’re wearing it.</p><p> The Inspire HR has all your health stats and apps available at the swipe of a finger. This is really a testament to the effectiveness of the fitness tracker’s minimal but routine-oriented design. You can monitor your heart rate 24&#x2F;7 without having to think about it, and you can also set up the Inspire HR to automatically detect when you start running without having to select the exercise app. It seems designed to keep your interactions with it to a minimum.</p><p> The backlit<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> touchscreen is very minimal, measuring about 1.5 inches tall and a little over a half an inch wide. It serves as a digital clock face with your current heart rate below as a default, and simple vertical and horizontal swipe commands will scroll you through the different features. In accordance with its slim dimensions, the touchscreen displays its main graphics as vertically-oriented elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0gwdaOIQKIt8c8pet5IIsJQo0a8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4057119-04-149ffa04853d425587e8b38d80542ed7.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Inspire HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Sync-with-the-Fitbit-app-and-you’re-ready-to-wear"><a href="#Setup-Process-Sync-with-the-Fitbit-app-and-you’re-ready-to-wear" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Sync with the Fitbit app and you’re ready to wear"></a><strong>Setup Process: Sync with the Fitbit app and you’re ready to wear</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR is simple to set up. You’ll need to connect it to the Fitbit app, which is available on both iOS and Android platforms, and the pairing process is very straightforward.</p><p> The entire setup takes about ten minutes, and the Fitbit app will give you quick tips for using your fitness tracker.

In Run mode, for instance, the Inspire HR will show you elapsed time, the distance you’ve covered, current mile pace, average mile pace, current heart rate, calories burned, the number of steps during your workout, as well as the digital clock face.</p><p> Unlike more high-end fitness smartwatches, the Inspire HR does not have built-in GPS. It instead calculates your distance and approximate mile pace by measuring your stride length with its in-built step counting technology. To get the most accurate GPS data, you will need to use Fitbit’s “connected GPS” feature. This requires you to take your smartphone along with you during your workout so the Inspire HR can access your phone’s GPS signal.</p><p> Although the mid-workout metrics referenced above are great for real-time monitoring, the relatively small touchscreen can be a challenge to navigate and refer to when exercising. Sweaty fingers or water on the device makes scrolling through your stats a challenge, too. While testing the Run mode on a hot and sweaty afternoon, it often took us a few attempts to use the touch commands.</p><p> Although the mid-workout metrics are great for real-time monitoring, the relatively small touchscreen can be a challenge to navigate and refer to when exercising.</p><p> One of the more advanced features of the Inspire HR is its combination of continuous heart rate monitoring and sleep monitoring. This fitness tracker has an optical heart rate monitor that uses photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure your pulse and gauge your heart rate, shining a rapidly-pulsating LED into your skin and measuring how your blood flow affects the dispersion of light. The Inspire HR is continually tracking your heart rate this way.</p><p> Sleep monitoring is another insightful feature that the Inspire HR offers. When synced with the Fitbit app, it can provide you with data on how long you spend in the different stages of sleep as a way to gauge the quality of your rest. This is especially useful for rigorous exercise training, such as training to race a marathon or set a PR.</p><p> If you simply wear the Inspire HR to bed, it will automatically detect when you are asleep through a combined lack of movement and changes in your heart rate patterns, known as heart rate variability (HRV). It will be able to tell how much time you spend in light, deep, and REM stages, and give you a more accurate chart of your resting heart rate. The value of sleep data for athletic performance makes sleep monitoring an accessible and highly beneficial entry point to gain in-depth insights into your body’s recovery and performance physiology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kpOf5qE4yUp_TsA4L5ERLgL3tbM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4057119-02-e84796705da049fbb75f5e2a098c1e8e.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Inspire HR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg"                      border="0"                >PearlMountain Image Converter</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Battery-Maximum-capacity-designed-for-24-7-wear"><a href="#Battery-Maximum-capacity-designed-for-24-7-wear" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Maximum capacity designed for 24&#x2F;7 wear"></a><strong>Battery: Maximum capacity designed for 24&#x2F;7 wear</strong></h2><p> The extended battery life of the Inspire HR makes for a true 24&#x2F;7 wellness monitoring experience. You can wear the Inspire HR for several days of activity on end.</p><p> Fitbit claims the Inspire HR battery will last up to five days with a full charge. We found this to be true—the unit we tested lasted a little over five full days before draining down to zero. Charging the Inspire HR took only about two hours before it was back at 100% again.</p><p> The extended battery life of the Inspire HR makes for a true 24&#x2F;7 wellness monitoring experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Features-Limited-to-the-Fitbit-wellness-model"><a href="#Software-Features-Limited-to-the-Fitbit-wellness-model" class="headerlink" title="Software Features: Limited to the Fitbit wellness model"></a><strong>Software Features: Limited to the Fitbit wellness model</strong></h2><p> The Inspire HR delivers all the key features that Fitbit has built its brand name around, but beyond the exercise apps, the software capabilities of the model are limited. One of the only extra features it has is the ability to show you call and text notifications when in Bluetooth range of your smartphone.</p><p> This fitness tracker is centered around displaying Fitbit’s core stats and exercise apps in combination with its heart rate functions. Integration with the Fitbit app is the best way to review your metrics in expanded categories, such as how many days out of the week you have elevated your heart rate enough for the Fitbit to log an exercise session (Fitbit refers to this as “active minutes”).</p><p> You can also set weekly goals for yourself with the Fitbit app, like aiming to hit a certain number of steps, and the Inspire HR will let you know how you’re doing and encourage you to move with notifications.</p><h2 id="Price-A-host-of-insights-at-a-good-price"><a href="#Price-A-host-of-insights-at-a-good-price" class="headerlink" title="Price: A host of insights at a good price"></a><strong>Price: A host of insights at a good price</strong></h2><p> At a reasonable $99.95 MSRP, the Fitbit Inspire HR can help anyone find the motivation to be more active. There are more budget-friendly fitness trackers out there, including several cheaper models from Fitbit. But the addition of heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking of the Fitbit Inspire HR—combined with the numerous exercise apps—means you get a really good amount of functionality for $100.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Fitbit-Inspire-HR-vs-Garmin-vivosport"><a href="#Fitbit-Inspire-HR-vs-Garmin-vivosport" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Inspire HR vs. Garmin vívosport"></a><strong>Fitbit Inspire HR vs. Garmin vívosport</strong></h2><p> One of the main competitors to Fitbit in the active wearables market is Garmin. The Garmin vívosport activity tracker is a competitor to the Fitbit Inspire HR and mimics its slim wristband design.</p><p> The vívosport features optical heart rate monitoring capabilities and has some extra features oriented specifically towards runners that the Fitbit Inspire HR does not include. The Garmin has full GPS, a VO2 max meter, and an altimeter for ascent and descent tracking. The Garmin Vivosport has a more expensive retail price of $169.99, but you can often find it on sale for around $120. Whether or not an extra chunk of change is worth the extra features is, of course, up to you and your fitness needs.</p><p> These additional features are staples of Garmin’s more advanced GPS watches that typically target a slightly different demographic than Fitbit. In this respect, one of the biggest selling points for the Fitbit Inspire HR is the integration of the brand’s popular and straightforward wellness model within its exercise apps. For example, the Run mode will calculate how many steps you took during your workout in addition to heart rate, duration, and distance metrics, making the accomplishment of total step count goals for any given day more accessible.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A motivating and wallet-friendly way to achieve wellness and performance goals.</strong></p><p> With the addition of continuous heart rate monitoring, the Fitbit Inspire HR turns the Fitbit app and its motivational metrics into a successful formula for a healthy lifestyle that any athlete can appreciate. Despite having a small display, the Inspire HR has a ton of training potential, and at a reasonable price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Inspire HR</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>UPC  811138033316</li><li>Price  $99.95</li><li>Weight  0.64 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.5 x 0.63 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Memory Capacity  7 days of activity data, 30 days of daily totals</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android, Windows 10</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth 4.0, Bluetooth LE</li><li>Ports  USB charging</li><li>Battery capacity  Up to 5 days</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Display  Grayscale OLED Touchscreen</li><li>Heart Rate Monitor  Yes</li><li>Memory Capacity  7 days of activity data, 30 days of daily totals</li><li>What’s included  Fitbit Inspire HR, small wrist band, large wrist band, USB charging cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-how-to-overcome-no-image-problem-in-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] How To Overcome No Image Problem in YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamers-dilemma-is-vlc-superior-to-mpc/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamer's Dilemma  Is VLC Superior to MPC?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-remote-meeting-effectiveness-through-optimized-zoom-recordings/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Remote Meeting Effectiveness Through Optimized Zoom Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-craft-your-creative-identity-mastering-instagram-photowatermarking-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Craft Your Creative Identity  Mastering Instagram Photowatermarking for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-expertise-in-speech-conversion-mastering-googles-method/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Expertise in Speech Conversion  Mastering Google’s Method</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-resource-for-adding-dynamic-gifs-to-discord-conversations/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Resource for Adding Dynamic GIFs to Discord Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-6-empowering-metaverse-instances-explained/"><u>2024 Approved  6 Empowering Metaverse Instances Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quickcapture-studio-chrome-os-snapper/"><u>2024 Approved  QuickCapture Studio  Chrome OS Snapper</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-secure-recording-of-conversations-what-you-need-to-know-about-whatsapp/"><u>2024 Approved  Secure Recording of Conversations  What You Need to Know About WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-smartphone-skills-producing-engaging-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>2024 Approved  Smartphone Skills  Producing Engaging YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-side-by-side-comparison-echo-pop-and-echo-dot-revealed/"><u>A Side-by-Side Comparison: Echo Pop and Echo Dot Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/aeiusys-compact-solar-generator-review-best-fit-for-delicate-electronics-and-medical-appliances-with-psw-inverter/"><u>Aeiusy's Compact Solar Generator Review: Best Fit for Delicate Electronics & Medical Appliances with PSW Inverter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/amazon-basic-soundbar-analysis-great-value-impressive-sound/"><u>Amazon Basic Soundbar Analysis -

Thankfully, both options support<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video playback.

Each has dedicated volume and playback controls and multi-function directional buttons that run on AAA batteries. Both remotes also include quick access buttons that let you quickly switch between streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ (these options vary).</p><p> Each streaming stick uses a separate micro-USB adapter for power and can be connected to either a wall outlet or directly to your TV for power.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cable-vs-streaming-5082949" >Cable vs. Streaming: What’s the Difference? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p> Both options include built-in Wi-Fi, meaning they don’t need to be hard-wired for anything to work, just an active wireless connection in your home. While they both include voice search, the Fire TV Stick 4K is slightly more responsive. It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support, making it just a dash of added functionality, especially if you’re already an owner of any of Amazon’s smart hubs.</p><p> Both remotes can also substitute for your handy TV remote. The baked-in Bluetooth connectivity for each device effectively replaces the 3.5mm audio jack in some previous versions, allowing you to wirelessly pair headphones and listen to the TV without disturbing others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fDygh71SKXWa7GJhGDgx-gXLQaw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/febbf2d3-010f-41d3-828f-2a038d0532be_1.36688055a9b3d6cca8cdd8adc2881437-b88a0309e7c5405d93ba58e6cd2aca8d.jpeg"                      alt="Roku Stick"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Mobile apps are available for both devices but drastically differ in their approach. The Roku app is easily the more impressive of the two, serving as an ad-hoc remote if your original happens to go missing and allowing you to quickly search for apps and media using your phone’s keyboard.</p><p> The Fires TV Stick app offers the primary home, menu, and back buttons, allowing you to perform a quick voice search, but it lacks the private listening feature offered on Roku.</p><p> The Fire TV Stick does have an additional barrier to set up, requiring an Amazon account before you’re up and running. While it isn’t needed, the Fire Stick does its best to nudge you towards an Amazon Prime subscription if you don’t already have one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Channels-Apps"><a href="#Channels-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Channels &#x2F; Apps"></a>Channels &#x2F; Apps</h2><p> While all the most popular streaming services are available on both devices, there are differences.

The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) ticks all those boxes. Despite its low price, this Roku TV is rich with features that rival more expensive options.</p><p> We tested the TCL 50S425 and were impressed by the ease of setup, picture quality, and user-friendliness of this<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8IJD6mxL-mHDn0MMWWRd5yZERlc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_04-bbd6d026c9ec48df9f12c934b7def674.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and straightforward"></a><strong>Design: Lightweight and straightforward</strong></h2><p> Smart TVs range in size, typically starting from 32 inches and reaching all the way up to 85 inches and beyond. If you can’t accommodate or don’t want a really large television, the TCL 50-inch Roku TV offers a decent middle ground that will appeal to shoppers who want an apartment or dorm-friendly TV without sacrificing quality.</p><p> In appearance, the TCL 50S425 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It’s black, rectangular, and slim. It comes with the option of wall-mounting or setting it up on a media console or other surface with the enclosed stand. With the legs attached, the set measures 44 inches wide, 28 inches tall, and 8 inches deep and weighs only 23.6 pounds. While the screen is categorized in the 50-inch class the size of the display is 49.5 inches on a diagonal. This lack of bulky bezels surrounding the screen contributes to the slim profile of this TV.</p><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV.</p><p> The Roku remote complements the streamlined design of the screen. In the style of other Roku remotes, it’s a compact and almost weightless wand-like infrared device with a simple and straightforward layout. We found it easy to hold in one hand and easily access all 20 buttons without having to make any grip adjustments. There are also a handful of shortcut buttons for quick access to Netflix, Hulu, the Roku Channel, and ESPN. As long as you point it directly toward the TV, you shouldn’t have any problems with remote performance, but we did notice an occasional lag here or there when the remote seemed to hang and then perform multiple actions in quick succession.</p><p> There are some unfortunate design quirks. The remote’s directional buttons are quite loud. They don’t require a hard press to activate, but they make an audible clicking sound. This is slightly jarring since the other buttons are nearly silent when pressed. Another drawback is the LED status indicator located in the bottom center of the display. By default this light is always on. You can turn this indicator off, but it will continue to blink and flash during other operations, which we sometimes found distracting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cT13RJhaMjC05v7eMym3vtM8M0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_05-70fc23cf6c2b4a13ac9d46f9372010ef.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Up and running in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Up and running in minutes</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 50-inch TCL Roku TV is a breeze. We opted to forego mounting the television, but the user manual indicates that this model is compatible with a VESA 200 x 200 wall mount with M6 x 12mm screws.</p><p> As directed, we placed the monitor face down on a plush surface and attached the two stand legs using the four MS x 25mm screws. After situating the television on a shelf, we plugged the unit into a wall outlet using the enclosed AC power cord. Once the TV was plugged in, it powered on immediately and displayed the guided setup process. These steps were very straightforward and included first setting a language preference, a network connection, and activating the device. The other critical step with setup involves either signing up for or logging into an existing Roku account.</p><p> Since we already had a Roku account, all of our previously selected channels and apps downloaded to the TV, which just took a few minutes, and then we were free to begin exploring. The amount of additional setup is pretty minimal. By default, you’ll see an HDR notification when you’re viewing HDR-enabled content, but you can turn this off from the settings panel if you like.</p><p> Additionally, if you plan to use a set-top cable box or antenna, the user manual offers straightforward instructions for doing so. You also have the option of enabling the Smart TV experience when you use antenna TV mode. This setting uses automatic content recognition (ACR) to make viewing recommendations based on what you view through your antenna or connected HDMI devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking</strong></h2><p> One of the biggest draws of a 4K TV is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which offers four times the resolution quality of a standard high definition TV. This pixel resolution is also commonly referred to as Ultra HD (UHD). This Roku TV also comes with HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is commonly bundled with 4K resolution in the newest smart TVs.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR improves image quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by intensifying the contrast between white and black areas on the screen while achieving a solid balance, so nothing looks too dark or too bright. It also broadens the palette of available colors, especially in combination with Wide Color Gamut (WCG).</p><p> One thing we noticed right out of the gate is how vivid 4K content looks. To test the 4K image quality, we started by exploring the 4K Spotlight content. This section includes links to 4K movies, TV, and videos. We found a couple of nature-themed 4K videos on YouTube and were really impressed with what we saw. A video touring Zion National Park looked almost 3D and we practically felt like we were there. The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> Apart from 4K nature videos, we also browsed 4K movies and TV shows through the Amazon Prime app. We found the same appealing mix of crisp picture quality, vibrant colors, and contrast. Even standard high definition shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime looked quite good on screen. Though it’s hard to say if there’s a considerable difference, TCL is eager to boast about the power of their 4K Creative Pro upscaling feature which renders regular HD content into 4K-like quality. The bottom line is that HD content looks great across the board, upscaled or not.</p><p> The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> With the handy multi-purpose asterisk button you can alter a number of display settings, and you can access this options menu in the middle of viewing content. Adjusting picture settings doesn’t require exiting an app or pausing whatever you’re watching, which lets you make adjustments and immediately see the result. You can add more vibrancy and contrast to whatever you’re watching, or enable modes like Movie when you’re viewing a film in the evening or with the lights dimmed.</p><p> You can control everything from backlighting to brightness, contrast, and dynamic contrast. This last setting is particularly relevant to HDR content because it helps balance the light and dark settings on your screen so that there’s no excess in either direction. The online user manual does a fine job of explaining some of the advanced picture settings, and even just toggling through the menu on the TV brings up a description of what you’re changing.</p><p> Regular picture mode and the predefined 4K HDR picture settings were on point, which made viewing right out of the box extremely easy and pleasant. We were also pleased by the picture quality from all angles. Getting too close or too far out to the right or left did reveal some shadows and distortion, but only at fairly extreme angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Lv4B9e6LaJSHW7NSl-Braa2vnmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_03-b8155781e440420aa0c6c2bf19f9fe6a.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding</strong></h2><p> While the TCL Roku TV offers impressive picture quality, the sound is less noteworthy. The two built-in 8-watt speakers offer decent volume levels, but there’s no advanced audio settings menu in this model. You do have control over aspects like sound mode and volume mode. The default sound mode is “normal,” which is appropriate for everyday viewing. But you can also select options for higher treble, more bass, movie, or music mode. As for volume modes, you can either turn on leveling, to balance the contrast between lows and highs in audio, or enable night mode, which sets a threshold for how high the volume can go.</p><p> We did notice some issues with what sounded like crackling and extreme lows and highs in dialog and music, though we were able to smooth these issues out by tweaking a few settings.</p><p> In our testing experience in a small room, the internal speakers were more than adequate without the need for additional speakers. If you do want another layer of dimension to your audio, you might consider opting for the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-speakers-and-home-theater-1846770" >wireless speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> designed specifically for Roku TV sets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3AbTZysdVWZbOWuuVGOa56_8c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_02-04183ae8dcd44b778b4da0e7706d5df2.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive and streamlined"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive and streamlined</strong></h2><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV and a big part of the equation is the operating system. The TCL 50S425 operates on Roku OS 9.1, and it’s extremely user-friendly. Updates are automatic so there’s no manual effort required on your part, and the interface is laid out in a clear and uncomplicated manner.</p><p> The Home screen features all of your apps, which you can arrange and delete with the click of the asterisk button. All the other menus are easy to identify as well. There’s a search page, a streaming channels section, and the settings menu. This clean and straightforward layout may not be the most sophisticated, but it’s easy to use and simplicity is the beauty of this system.</p><p> While the remote doesn’t come with a built-in speaker, the free Roku app does offer a voice-assistant feature. It’s best when completing a general search for a show or actor or for launching a particular app. If you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa enabled device, this Roku TV will support them, and they offer a generally better experience than using the Roku app voice remote function.</p><h2 id="Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great bargain on a budget"></a><strong>Price: A great bargain on a budget</strong></h2><p> If you don’t want to spend a fortune on a 4K TV, but you want to get as much value as possible, the TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a compelling option. It retails for $350, which situates it in the growing and competitive class of 4K TVs under $500. In the TCL 4-Series alone you have several other models to consider that all share the same specifications except for size. The larger 55-inch TCL Roku TV retails for just $30 more than the 50-inch version and features a larger screen size of 54.6 inches. It may not seem considerable, but if you’re limited with space, the extra width and height (five and two inches, respectively) can actually feel like a pretty massive difference. And if you opt for a smaller display and a lower price tag, the 43-inch TCL Roku TV retails for about $280, but you’re sacrificing 7 inches of display.</p><h2 id="TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition"><a href="#TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition" class="headerlink" title="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"></a><strong>TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</strong></h2><p> The TCL 50-inch Roku TV is not without external competitors either. The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition retails for about $100 more and runs on the Fire OS, which stands toe-to-toe with the Roku platform with access to over 500,000 shows and movies. The Toshiba Fire TV comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, an edge for shoppers who want the ease of a voice assistant built right into the remote.

The former, however is visibly taller, wider, and bulkier. The Toshiba Fire TV does havea slight advantage when it comes to audio quality.

You may find better 4K picture and audio quality in a higher-end model, but this TV offers a welcome smart TV upgrade at a price that won’t empty your pockets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-xbr49x900f-49-inch-4k-ultra-hd-smart-led-tv-review-4796665" >Sony XBR49X900F 49-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/insignia-ns-43df710na19-fire-tv-edition-review-4770716" >Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lg-27ud58-b27-inch-4k-uhd-ips-monitor-review-4778916" >LG 27UD58-B 27-Inch 4K UHD IPS Monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  50S425 50-inch 4K Smart LED Roku TV</li><li>Product Brand  TCL</li><li>MPN  50S425</li><li>Price  $349.99</li><li>Weight  23.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  44.1 x 28 x 8 in.</li><li>Screen Size  49.5 inches</li><li>Platform  Roku OS</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160 pixels</li><li>Ports  HDMI x3, USB, Headphone, Digital Audio Optical, RF, Ethernet</li><li>Formats  HD, 4K UHD, HDR10</li><li>Speakers  Two 8-watt</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-your-entertainment-game-on-roku-and-facebook-live/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elevating Your Entertainment Game on Roku and Facebook LIVE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-tracking-trends-the-systematic-method-for-assessing-youtube-income-flows/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Tracking Trends  The Systematic Method for Assessing YouTube Income Flows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-enhance-collaboration-with-these-zoom-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enhance Collaboration with These Zoom Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-collection-of-sandbox-games/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Collection of Sandbox Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-reversed-video-techniques-for-instagram-savvy-users/"><u>[New] Reversed Video Techniques for Instagram Savvy Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-mi-11-screenshot-and-record-playbook-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Mi 11 Screenshot & Record Playbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-top-techniques-for-capturing-ps3-gaming-moments-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top Techniques for Capturing PS3 Gaming Moments for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-game-on-everywhere-selecting-top-5-emulators-for-playing-gb-classics-on-windows-pcs/"><u>[Updated] Game On Everywhere! -

It improves over Synology’s older RT1900AC in just about every way, it’s compatible with their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-set-up-a-mesh-network-4690007" >mesh wireless system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it boasts some pretty impressive specifications.</p><p> We recently set a Synology RT2600AC up in a home network environment to test things like performance, speed and throughput, ease of installation, extra features, and more. To find out whether this router is worth the asking price, continue reading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/piu6UDZH5iV5uLuoAJ9_iyBkSbs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4140134_SynologyRT2600AC-4-2e7bd8b3176c43cbb7ea18d0a7fd733f.jpg"                      alt="Synology RT2600ac Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Design-Basic-black-with-a-cumbersome-foot"><a href="#Design-Basic-black-with-a-cumbersome-foot" class="headerlink" title="Design: Basic black with a cumbersome foot"></a><strong>Design: Basic black with a cumbersome foot</strong></h2><p> The Synology RT2600AC plays it straight in the design department, with a black rectangular aesthetic that doesn’t do a whole lot to set itself apart from the crowd. The blocky design is broken up somewhat by angled ventilation slots on the top of the device, and you’ll also find a full suite of indicator lights front and center.</p><p> This is a 4x4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >multi-user multiple input multiple output <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (MU-MIMO) router with four large antennas, two of which are mounted on the back, with the other two located on either side of the device. The antennas can be rotated and snap into place in 90, 135, and 180 degrees.</p><p> When you set this router on a flat surface, it doesn’t sit flat due to a raised foot on the back of the device.</p><p> On the front of the router, you’ll find an SD card, which can be used as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/network-attached-storage-nas-introduction-to-nas-4096633" >network-attached storage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (NAS). The rear of the router also features a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can be used for the same purpose. You’ll also find the power button, a WAN port, and five LAN Ethernet ports on the back. One side of the device features WPS and Wi-Fi buttons, while the other features a second USB port and a media eject button.</p><p> When you set this router on a flat surface, it doesn’t sit flat due to a raised foot on the back of the device. This gives the router a bit of a unique look, and may help in heat management, but it also makes it extremely difficult to wall mount.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> Setup with the Synology RT2600AC was just about as easy as it gets. We connected the router to the internet and our test PC, set up an administrator account on the router, created a network SSID, and were prompted to select whether the device should act as a router or an access point, and that was about it.</p><p> The Synology RT2600AC has a great web-based dashboard that provides a surprising amount of flexibility and control, but you don’t really have to dig into it to set up your network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Fon9Kf12Iyv-UvAXdiVS60Iy9ak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4140134_SynologyRT2600AC-2-869832693a4e44fba36235c6d273e710.jpg"                      alt="Synology RT2600ac Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Connectivity-AC2600-with-MU-MIMO-functionality-and-optional-mesh-system"><a href="#Connectivity-AC2600-with-MU-MIMO-functionality-and-optional-mesh-system" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: AC2600 with MU-MIMO functionality and optional mesh system"></a><strong>Connectivity: AC2600 with MU-MIMO functionality and optional mesh system</strong></h2><p> The Synology RT2600AC is an AC2600 MU-MIMO dual-band router that offers a theoretical maximum wireless bandwidth of 2.53Gbps, with 800Mbps over the2.4 GHz frequency and 1,733Mbps over the 5GHz frequency. It’s also capable of bonding two high-speed connections with a dual-WAN option. You aren’t likely to see those speeds in real life, even with the dual-WAN, but you can check out the next section to see what kind of speeds to expect.</p><p> This router supports MU-MIMO, which is a technology that’s designed to allow multiple devices to connect at once, using different wireless standards, without suffering any slowdown as a result. It also supports automatic band steering to ensure that each wireless device in your network maintains the fastest and most reliable connection it can handle.</p><p> The Synology RT2600AC is an AC2600 MU-MIMO dual-band router that offers a theoretical maximum wireless bandwidth of 2.53Gbps.</p><p> The Synology RT2600AC is a bit lacking in terms of Ethernet ports, but the loadout is fairly standard for a mid-range router. It has a single WAN port for connecting to a modem, and then just four Ethernet ports for your devices. If you choose to use one of those as an additional WAN port, you’ll definitely need to look for a switch to expand your capacity.</p><p> If you’re looking to connect some storage to your network to stream media or back up files, this router includes an SD card slot, a USB 2.0 port, and a USB 3.0 port. We found the NAS to be a bit on the slow side, but it works well enough.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gL7PCkiCXZfJYxr3IOZK7ZWTjVA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4140134_SynologyRT2600AC-5-5e348c0998894a49b99d883620886b19.jpg"                      alt="Synology RT2600ac Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-Wi-Fi-but-the-Ethernet-is-a-bit-slow"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-Wi-Fi-but-the-Ethernet-is-a-bit-slow" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast Wi-Fi, but the Ethernet is a bit slow"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fast Wi-Fi, but the Ethernet is a bit slow</strong></h2><p> We tested network throughput performance on a Mediacom gigabit internet connection, performing extensive tests on both the wired Ethernet connection and the dual-band Wi-Fi.</p><p> When connected to the Synology RT2600AC via a wired Ethernet connection, we were able to achieve a maximum download speed of 470Mbps. This gigabit internet connection notched speeds of over 900Mbps using another router during the same test set, so the Synology unit left a little to be desired there.</p><p> Next up, we connected to the Wi-Fi network with our wireless device roughly three feet from the router. Using the Ookla speed test app, we averaged 394Mbps down and 59Mbps up. That’s fast enough to stream 4K video and just about anything else, but it was pretty much in the middle of the road for routers that we tested using this internet connection and this test machine.</p><p> This router is worth a look if you want something that’s easy to set up but hides a lot of hidden potential under the hood.</p><p> We performed our next test about 15 feet from the router with a closed door between the router and our mobile device. At that distance, we measured an average download speed of 357Mbps and upload speeds of about 62Mbps.</p><p> Our next test was performed 30 feet from the router with two walls and various furniture and other items between the router and our test device. At that range, measured speeds dropped to an average of about 259Mbps, with upload speeds tanking to 27Mbps.</p><p> The Synology RT2600AC isn’t the fastest router we’ve tested, but it did exhibit speeds and range good enough to stream video, play games, and perform other tasks on the internet throughout our 1,800 square feet of space.</p><p> While the Synology RT2600AC was designed to be used alone, it’s important to note that it’s fully compatible with Synology’s newer MR2200AC satellite routers. That means you can add one or more MR2200AC units to your network to create a mesh network and eliminate any Wi-Fi dead zones you might have.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Mu3C8M_Uu7Qj2I8pEG0ZQY2yuWk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4140134_SynologyRT2600AC-3-f2de05f104de4db2bed80b4e39246c1b.jpg"                      alt="Synology RT2600ac Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Windows-like-web-console"><a href="#Software-Windows-like-web-console" class="headerlink" title="Software: Windows-like web console"></a><strong>Software: Windows-like web console</strong></h2><p> The Synology RT2600AC uses a Windows-like web console that’s a massive improvement over a lot of the competition. You can also change some settings through a phone app, like parental controls, guest networking, and basic wireless settings, but most of the advanced controls are locked behind the web console.</p><p> The web console is tile-based, including tiles for the network center, control panel, package center, and help center. The network center tile allows you to check current download and upload speeds at a glance, check out a list of connected devices, set up traffic and parental controls, configure your wireless settings and firewall, and more. The control panel digs into options like setting up network-attached storage and network printers, and the package center allows you to download additional packages.</p><p> The Synology RT2600AC uses a Windows-like web console that’s a massive improvement over a lot of the competition.</p><p> Some of the packages you can grab include cloud file sharing utilities, VPN utilities, and other things that can expand and increase the functionality of your Synology router.</p><h2 id="Price-A-little-expensive-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-A-little-expensive-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: A little expensive for what you get"></a><strong>Price: A little expensive for what you get</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $240, and typically available for about $200, the Synology RT2600AC is a little on the pricey side for the underlying technology, functionality, and performance of the router.

However, the Netgear Nighthawk actually tested better during our in-house testing, with faster-wired speeds, faster wireless speeds, and better coverage.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk does have fewer antennas, and it also lacks an SD card slot. We also like the Synology’s web portal a lot more than Netgear’s solution. This isn’t exactly a deal-breaker, but the Synology web portal is very easy to use, and the package manager feature allows you to add useful functionality like VPN integration even if you don’t have a lot of experience with routers.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>This is a rock-solid router if you can get it for the right price.</strong></p><p> The Synology RT2600AC is a decent mid-range router that suffers from just a handful of minor issues. You’ll probably need a network switch, and it underperformed a bit in our speed tests, but it still posted decent numbers. The fact that you can use it in a mesh system is also a nice touch, as is the fact that Synology continues to improve the router with regular firmware updates and new packages to extend the functionality of the device. This router is worth a look if you want something that’s easy to set up but hides a lot of hidden potential under the hood.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  RT2600ac Dual-Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router</li><li>Product Brand  Synology</li><li>UPC  RT2600ac</li><li>Price  $199.99</li><li>Weight  1.54 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11 x 6 x 3 in.</li><li>Warranty  Two years</li><li>Compatibility  IEEE 802.11ac</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antennas  4x4 MIMO Omni-directional high-gain dipole (2.4GHz &#x2F; 5GHz)</li><li>Number of Bands  Simultaneous dual band</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  4</li><li>Chipset  1.7 GHz Qualcomm IPQ8065</li><li>Range  2,000 sq. ft.</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-harnessing-customer-stories-for-brand-growth/"><u>[New] Harnessing Customer Stories for Brand Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-humor-hacks-simplifying-the-process-of-meme-creation/"><u>[New] Humor Hacks  Simplifying the Process of Meme Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-recovering-the-solitary-sound-device/"><u>[New] In 2024, Recovering the Solitary Sound Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-depth-guide-obs-for-gamers/"><u>[New] In-Depth Guide  OBS for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-secrets-to-stunning-nightscape-shots-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Secrets to Stunning Nightscape Shots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discover-the-power-of-snapchat-boomers-quickly-and-effectively/"><u>2024 Approved  Discover the Power of Snapchat Boomers – Quickly & Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-dji-drone-prospectus-phantom-3-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  DJI Drone Prospectus  Phantom 3 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flipping-srt-to-sub-easy-conversion-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved  Flipping SRT to SUB  Easy Conversion Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-scrutinizing-hdr-performance-in-luminance-tech/"><u>2024 Approved  Scrutinizing HDR Performance in Luminance Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/8-safe-and-effective-methods-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-15-plus-without-a-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>8 Safe and Effective Methods to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Without a Passcode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/achieve-your-fitness-goals-using-the-versatile-fitbit-versa-3-equipped-with-built-in-gps-and-comprehensive-wellness-apps/"><u>Achieve Your Fitness Goals Using the Versatile Fitbit Versa 3 -

The Series 9 costs the same as the Series 7 and 8, so there’s little reason to purchase last year’s model.</p><p> You can use your old watch bands and cases on a newer model, which is convenient.</p><p> On the other hand, if you have an Apple Watch Series 7 or later that works well and has a good battery, there’s little reason to upgrade. (The Series 4 and newer watches are eligible for watchOS 10 if you have an iPhone XS or more recent.)</p><p> One thing to know is that if you get an Apple Watch, you should have an iPhone too. It doesn’t play well with Android smartphones and won’t pair over Bluetooth.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-vs-fitbit-8650200" >I Tried Both: Apple Watch Series 9

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk is a powerful gaming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a surprisingly decent value to those that lack the time or ability to build a gaming desktop from scratch. I say this, reluctantly, as someone who has spent his entire life building gaming desktops by hand, not to mention countless video editing workstations for coworkers at the various places I’ve been employed. All this to say that I’m an advocate for building your own PC, but I still believe the OMEN is a pretty good value for a lot of people.</p><p> As configured, our HP OMEN Obelisk came equipped with Intel’s 9th gen i9-9900K and Nvidia’s GTX 2080 Super, a top-tier combination that makes light work of just about any game you might throw its way. All this comes at a cost for this tiny enclosure, however, and the components get very hot under load. The i9-9900k is an absolute furnace of a CPU to begin with, and the single 120mm AIO water cooler can only do so much.</p><p> How has HP reconciled all these things, and what does it mean for potential owners? Let’s take a look at the performance, build quality, and usability of this space-conscious gaming desktop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OXMiCXvzh8P7esVvbjPoSorzoxM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-2-7b14850c2ca84af39d5fd116ab483d5d.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations"><a href="#Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations" class="headerlink" title="Design : Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations"></a><strong>Design</strong> : <strong>Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close. Overall, HP did a pretty decent job here, but there are plenty of areas for improvement.</p><p> The first area of concern is the chassis itself. The shell of the OMEN case is constructed mainly out of plastic, which I’m sure helping a lot to keep shipping costs down, but definitely keeps the desktop from feeling like a solid, premium piece of hardware. It also makes me concerned about how durable it will be over time. Most buyers looking to spend this much on a gaming PC want to get some good mileage out of it, so this is somewhat disconcerting.</p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close.</p><p> The top&#x2F;front of the case features 2x USB 3.1 ports, a microphone and headphone port, and a power button. The USB ports are slightly misaligned on the model that I received making it a bit of a chore to plug anything in. I would love to have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the front here since more and more peripherals are moving towards USB-C. An SD card reader would also have been nice for those out there that shoot video and photos, but I realize not everyone shares the same needs.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent. The side of the case features a simple button release, so getting inside is extremely painless. If you are planning on adding more hard drives, HP has pre-wired two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009" >SATA cables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and SATA power connectors for you, and a plastic tray is present in the two drive bays for easy mounting.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent.</p><p> Beyond adding more RAM or storage, you’re going to hit a wall pretty quickly. There are no mounts for additional fans to be installed anywhere, and there isn’t room in the case for many other CPU cooling options, should you be unhappy with the thermals. The pre-installed 120mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >AIO water cooler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is no match for the i9-9900k, where temperatures regularly crested 90°C during heavy workloads.</p><p> The OMEN gets plenty of things right as well. The plastic design might not be my favorite, but I absolutely adore the compact form factor. To put it in perspective, my already somewhat modest mid-tower case, the NZXT H440, measures 8.6 x 20.2 x 18.9 inches (HWD). The Omen, on the other hand, measures just 6.5 x 14.06 x 17.05 inches. Side by side, it’s plainly visible how much smaller the OMEN is, and for those with limited desk space, this will make a noticeable difference.</p><p> The lighting system is also approachable and understated, giving a little bit of customizable flare without going too over the top. As you’ll see later in the software section, HP has made it very straightforward to tweak any of these settings to your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gfeGQoUwG35q5t-JwO07Ax4jm5I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-3-f4e655ec9e684a47855e9ee7373ba4b6.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity"><a href="#Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Great components for gaming and productivity"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Great components for gaming and productivity</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk that I tested featured a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 9900K, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super graphics card. This is a potent combination of components in a gaming PC, and I was appropriately impressed by the results.</p><p> The desktop scored an impressive 6,967 in the productivity-focused benchmarking application PCMark 10. On the gaming front, the Omen managed a score of 10,740 in 3DMark’s Time Spy. In real-world use, this means more than 60fps at 4K in many popular titles like GTA V, but less than 60fps in others like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. In other words, the Omen is mostly capable of 4K gameplay and is nearly always capable of 60+ fps in most common resolutions shy of 4K.</p><p> The Omen comes equipped with a 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453" >NVMe SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and 32GB of DDR4 2666 memory. This is definitely more RAM than games alone will call for, but it’s merely an adequate amount of RAM for some creative professionals working with more demanding software like Adobe After Effects. Keep in mind though, even those that don’t normally need a lot of RAM can still benefit from having more. Among other things, it gives you the luxury of keeping all of your browser tabs and background applications running without having to start juggling applications on and off, which can be helpful from a productivity standpoint.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles"><a href="#Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles" class="headerlink" title="Gaming :Great for the most demanding titles"></a><strong>Gaming</strong> :<strong>Great for the most demanding titles</strong></h2><p> Gaming performance is great on the HP OMEN Obelisk thanks to the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super and Intel i9-9900K combo. I tested a number of games on my 3440x1440 monitor to get a sense of performance. To put this in perspective, this resolution is roughly 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K monitor.</p><p> First up was GTA V, which I tested with everything except for MSA (anti-aliasing) and the settings in the advanced tab turned up to Very High, the maximum setting. I recorded an average of 120.6fps across the 5 passes that the benchmark runs.</p><p> Emboldened by these results, I went back and turned every last thing up to its maximum setting, including everything in the advanced tab_and_ 8x MSA. I was quickly brought back down to earth, with an average result of 46.6fps. For one last pass, I nudged the MSA down to 4x, and came up with a healthy average of 66.8fps. Maybe dreams can come true after all.</p><p> Next, I wanted to try something fairly CPU intensive, so I ran the in-game benchmark for Civilization VI. I used the default settings for the Ultra preset, which netted me an average of 145.5fps. This was certainly an easy win for the OMEN Obelisk.</p><p> Lastly, I ran the notoriously resource-heavy Deus Ex: Mankind Divided using a few different profiles. On Ultra settings, the OMEN Obelisk saw just 55.7fps on average, with a minimum of 44.6fps and a maximum of 61.6fps. Dialing things down one level to Very High, things looked only slightly rosier: 58.1fps average, 49.5fps minimum, 62.2fps maximum. Finally, turning it down one more level to High found a sweet spot: 75.8fps average, 62.8fps minimum, 96.6 FPS maximum.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pz9tV-mhJl_Cjm8HSqEQ_VZPbVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-5-cdbd9d78a8c14b8e8bce0113d12e9fcc.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much" class="headerlink" title="Network :Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much</strong></h2><p> The HP Omen Obelisk has gigabit LAN and a Wi-Fi 5 (2x2) networking, the latter supporting a maximum speed of 866 Mbps. Everything functioned smoothly from a networking standpoint during my tests.</p><p> I made a point to try out the Network Booster software found in the OMEN Command Center and didn’t see anything tremendously useful, unfortunately. I tried setting the priority of Steam to “Low” and downloading a game, but the game still downloaded at my maximum internet speed. I took it one step further and toggled the “Block” option for Steam, and tried to resume the download, but Steam kept on downloading at the maximum speed. The software was successful in blocking Chrome when that option was switched on, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Just-enough-options"><a href="#Software-Just-enough-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Just enough options"></a><strong>Software: Just enough options</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk comes with the OMEN Command Center, which is used to manage your desktop as well as any other OMEN products such as headsets, keyboards, and mice. From here, you have the option to click on your desktop and start managing your PC or choose from one of the various other options such as rewards, coaching, remote play, and My Games (a game launcher).</p><p> Select OMEN DESKTOP and you can access system vitals like GPU utilization, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and CPU&#x2F;GPU temperatures. This is also where you can access the lighting profiles, overclocking options, and a “network booster” that lets you prioritize application bandwidth usage.</p><p> The lighting is executed fairly well on the HP OMEN Obelisk. There are only two lighting zones: one for the interior of the case, and one for the logo on the front exterior. Through the OMEN Command Center, you can set and customize lighting profiles for each zone. You can choose a static color, but also may choose from animation profiles that cycle between preset or user-defined colors. Luckily you can also choose the brightness, if you want to tone down the lighting a bit, and choose a separate profile for when the desktop is asleep.</p><p> The option to overclock your system has you first run a nondescript benchmark, which produces a score with no reference point (to establish a baseline). While it’s nice to have the option, this really,<em>sincerely</em> isn’t a system you want to be overclocking. The i9-9900K CPU already runs alarmingly hot, even with its pre-installed water cooling solution. There also isn’t enough room for anything beyond a 120mm AIO watercooler, and not nearly enough clearance for a popular air heatsink like the Noctua NH-D15.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Highly-competitive"><a href="#Price-Highly-competitive" class="headerlink" title="Price: Highly competitive"></a><strong>Price: Highly competitive</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk with the same specs as this one can be found for around $2,000, at least when it’s in stock. Despite a lot of flaws that I can point to a nit-pick about, the price is one of the main reasons I still consider the OMEN to be a solid deal. I went through the trouble of parting out a similar build on PCPartPicker, going as far as to cut corners where I usually wouldn’t, and still arrived at just under $1800 before tax.</p><p> As far as I’m concerned, $200 is a perfectly reasonable premium to pay for a system that is already assembled and shipped to your door.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J3cZUfrEy-ALtFpRbDRhw7FZI8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-4-f78d504d7bd348eca19b7e65b4d10289.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro"><a href="#HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro" class="headerlink" title="HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro"></a><strong>HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro</strong></h2><p> If you want something even smaller, and even more monolithic, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/corsair-one-pro-review-5072820" >Corsair One Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Systems/CORSAIR-ONE/CORSAIR-ONE-PRO-i180-Compact-Workstation-Grade-PC/p/CS-9040001-NA" >Corsair <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) manages to pack a high-end gaming rig in a minuscule 12-liter case, making even the HP OMEN seem large by comparison. It has a very solid construction and manages to fit water cooling for both the CPU and GPU inside its small frame.</p><p> The Corsair One will of course be less customizable and harder to work in, and caps out at 32GB of RAM as opposed to the OMEN’s 64GB. The main differentiation however is the price—the Corsair One in a similar configuration to the OMEN will cost at least $900 more. Nonetheless, for those that really don’t plan to do any tweaking whatsoever, that value space above all else, might still consider the Corsair One.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>High performance and fantastic value, but upsetting thermals.</strong></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk delivers fantastic value for gamers shopping for a high-performance, pre-built PC. HP has come a long way, and now offers a much more compelling solution that will appeal to a much broader set of buyers. That said, there is work to be done still, as the case suffers from poor airflow, poor thermals, and not a lot of meaningful ways to improve them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Omen Obelisk</li><li>Product Brand  HP</li><li>SKU  B07WQ68VR8</li><li>Price  $1,999.00</li><li>Release Date  August 2019</li><li>Weight  29 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  20.4 x 19.4 x 11.8 in.</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i9-9900K</li><li>Cooling  120mm AIO liquid cooling</li><li>Graphics  Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super</li><li>Memory  32GB RAM (expandable to 64GB)</li><li>Storage  1TB M.2 NVMe</li><li>Ports  7x USB 3.0, 1 headphone, 1x USB-C, 1x HDMI, 3x Display Port, 1x USB-C (display)</li><li>Power Supply  750W</li><li>Network  Wi-Fi 5 (2x2), Gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth 4.2</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-broadcast-your-curated-playlist-with-ease/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Broadcast Your Curated Playlist with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-voice-fixes-for-your-snapchat-snaps-using-dual-methods/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Quick Voice Fixes for Your Snapchat Snaps Using Dual Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-playlist-power-instagrams-musical-edge/"><u>[New] In 2024, Playlist Power  Instagram's Musical Edge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-professionals-choice-top-10-ig-video-editing-platforms-for-2024/"><u>[New] Professionals' Choice  Top 10 IG Video Editing Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-understanding-the-impact-of-circular-videography/"><u>[New] Understanding the Impact of Circular Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-a-step-by-step-review-of-using-showmore-for-video-capture-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Step-by-Step Review of Using ShowMore for Video Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-get-into-a-friends-live-showcase-effortlessly/"><u>[Updated] Get Into a Friend's Live Showcase Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/a-quick-guide-to-xiaomi-redmi-k70-frp-bypass-instantly-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Quick Guide to Xiaomi Redmi K70 FRP Bypass Instantly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/an-s-n-curve-represents-the-relationship-between-stress-amplitude-and-cycles-to-failure-for-a-material-under-fatigue-loading/"><u>An S-N Curve Represents the Relationship Between Stress Amplitude and Cycles to Failure for a Material Under Fatigue Loading.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/avoiding-disasters-committing-to-weekly-windows-backup/"><u>Avoiding Disasters: Committing to Weekly Windows Backup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/balancing-the-flaws-and-wonders-of-cyberpunk-2n77-review/"><u>Balancing the Flaws and Wonders of Cyberpunk 2N77 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/caixuns-big-screen-marvel-in-depth-analysis-of-the-budget-friendly-75-inch-4k-smart-tv-experience/"><u>Caixun's Big Screen Marvel: In-Depth Analysis of the Budget-Friendly 75-Inch 4K Smart TV Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/canon-vixia-hf-r800-camcorder-review-modest-price-average-video/"><u>Canon VIXIA HF R800 Camcorder Review: Modest Price, Average Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/compact-fast-and-cheap-the-most-affordable-in-car-car-chargers-reviewed-discover-the-best/"><u>Compact, Fast & Cheap: The Most Affordable In-Car Car Chargers Reviewed -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs**<p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market.

Compatible with Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10, Vista, XP, 2000 and macOS, this modem can work with just about any computer. It also is compatible with most cable internet providers, including Comcast Xfinity, Time Warner Cable, Charter, Cox and more.</p><p> It does not, however, work with bundled voice services that some people still use with cable bundles. When it comes to raw functionality, the CM500 can support 16 downloads and four uploads simultaneously. It can support HD and 4K video streaming, too. And all of this comes in at an affordable price that will save you money on a monthly rental.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Cable-Modem"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Cable-Modem" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Cable Modem"></a>What to Look For in a Cable Modem</h2><p> The world is becoming increasingly connected, and ensuring you have a decent connection in your home is more important than ever. Not only does that mean ensuring you’re subscribed to a fast internet service, but you also have the proper hardware to provide a fast and stable connection whenever needed.</p><p> A home internet network has two main components:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-modem-and-router-4159854" >a modem and a router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The modem converts a cable signal from your internet service provider (ISP) into something a digital device like a computer can understand. The router then distributes that signal to the computers and other connected devices in your home, either via<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338" >wired Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> connections or by beaming it out over Wi-Fi, which is how you get wireless internet connectivity in your home.</p><p> Of course, there are many things to consider when buying a modem. You don’t always need to buy a modem, as you can typically rent one directly from your ISP, although if you do the math, you’ll likely find it makes more financial sense to buy your own. Then, you’ll need to consider whether you want a modem&#x2F;router combo and what features you want from your modem—including what modern connection protocols it supports, the number of channels it offers, and how quickly it can upload and download files.</p><p> Whether you think you know everything you need to or are starting from scratch, here are all the features you should remember while buying a modem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1SZf8UwoZuAHJOglWXBzaJfrml8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-2-5bacf868c9e77c002c9555f3.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="When-Should-You-Rent-Your-Cable-Modem"><a href="#When-Should-You-Rent-Your-Cable-Modem" class="headerlink" title="When Should You Rent Your Cable Modem?"></a>When Should You Rent Your Cable Modem?</h3><p> Before diving into the features to consider when buying a modem, it’s worth considering the possibility of renting one from your ISP. The modems on offer by ISPs are generally decent in quality (though not as good as the modems you can buy), plus going with a rental saves you from doing the legwork of finding one on your own. Further, if anything goes wrong with your cable modem, your ISP will take responsibility for fixing or replacing it, often even sending a technician to your home to take care of everything for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9DXQaEhGunRAssafYX-TGybEsSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear-Nighthawk-C7000-5x4-465340ea47c74a319d9e8ae148401aeb.jpg"                      alt="Netgear-Nighthawk C7000"                ></p><p> Generally, though, we recommend against renting a modem from your ISP. Since the rental often comes out to between $10 and $15 per month, you can save a lot of money by purchasing your own. For example, buying a modem&#x2F;router combo for just $75 can quickly recoup your costs in less than a year.</p><p> That doesn’t mean that there aren’t situations in which you should rent a modem. For starters, if you’re not very tech-savvy or don’t like troubleshooting problems, renting a modem may be the way to go, as you’ll often get complete repair services from your ISP.</p><p> For most, we recommend buying your modem. You’ll get much more control over your home network, and after a few years, you’ll have recouped the cost of the devices you would have otherwise had to rent. There’s no need to worry about hardware problems either since they are rare among the more well-known brands, and all come with a standard warranty.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Compatibility with Your ISP<p> There are other advantages to buying your modem. For starters, the modems you can rent from your ISP are usually on the older side and may not offer as fast or stable of a connection as you could get with something more modern. Most of the time, ISP modems lack features, preventing you from getting much control over your home network, which might be vital if you want to tweak your network’s settings.</p><p> Before buying a modem, it’s worth double-checking that the modem you’re interested in is compatible with your ISP. Unfortunately, not all modems are supported by every ISP. Most ISPs will have a list of compatible modems on their website, or, at the very least, you should be able to contact customer service to find out.</p><p> If you subscribe to voice services from your ISP, such as Xfinity from Comcast Internet with Voice, you must ensure that the cable modem you purchase supports your provider’s voice services. While it’s theoretically possible to run your old voice-capable cable modem in parallel with a newer, high-performance modem, this can get messy and needs to be supported in some cases. Besides, the main point of buying a cable modem is that you don’t have to keep paying rental fees for the old one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mczhPmklHisJ3nV93MiYFCIrGPA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-4-5bacf875c9e77c0025819a90.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700 combo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1?<br> DOCSIS, a short form for “Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification,” is the technology on which all cable modems are based. DOCSIS 3.0 is the standard currently being used by almost all cable providers, but even though it offers theoretical speeds of up to 1Gbps, most ISPs in the U.S. don’t go beyond 600Mbps over DOCSIS 3.0. You’ll need a DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem to get actual multi-gigabit plans. Don’t worry if your ISP doesn’t support the newer standard yet, though, as all DOCSIS 3.1 modems are fully backward compatible with DOCSIS 3.0, so you can buy one now to be ready when those faster speeds do come along.</li><li>What happens if your cable modem breaks down?<br> While it’s true that one of the advantages of renting your cable modem from your ISP is they’ll easily swap it out if you have any problems—something that won’t be an option if you’ve bought your own—the reality is that modern cable modems are very reliable as long as you go with a trusted brand, and almost all of them also come with 1–2 year warranties.</li><li>What about cable modem&#x2F;router combos?<br> If you’re in the market for a new wireless router, it might be worth considering a cable modem&#x2F;router combo instead since you’ll get the best of both worlds in a much more affordable package. There’s rarely any good reason to go that route if you’re pleased with the Wi-Fi router you already have, though any cable modem should work just fine with any relatively modern router.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/days-gone-one-riders-quest-to-conquer-the-post-apocalyptic-wasteland-and-its-zombie-menace/"><u>'Days Gone': One Rider's Quest to Conquer the Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland and Its Zombie Menace</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-burst-into-action-the-art-of-engaging-instagram-boomers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Burst Into Action  The Art of Engaging Instagram Boomers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ideal-systems-for-recording-and-streaming-athletic-competitions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ideal Systems for Recording and Streaming Athletic Competitions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-crafting-a-journalistic-closing-statement/"><u>[New] Crafting a Journalistic Closing Statement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/nhancing-viewer-interest-with-accurate-time-stamping/"><u>[New] Enhancing Viewer Interest with Accurate Time Stamping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-value-gaming-peripherals-for-under-100/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Best Value Gaming Peripherals for Under $100</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/2024s-leading-routers-with-built-in-parent-control-features/"><u>2024'S Leading Routers with Built-In Parent Control Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-realme-12-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>3 Facts You Need to Know about Screen Mirroring Realme 12 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-nubia-z50-ultra-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Nubia Z50 Ultra?

The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low. The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short"></a><strong>Competition: Falls short</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Logitech C270</em> :</strong> The Logitech C270 is a low-cost webcam that goes for $40 MSRP, though you can frequently find it for approximately $20. For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason. This camera doesn’t come close to delivering what it promises, meaning it’s not worth even the trifle you’d pay for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  USB 2.0 12 Megapixel</li><li>Product Brand  Docooler</li><li>UPC  B00OB883F6</li><li>Price  $8.00</li><li>Weight  2.5 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.75 x 1.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Color  Transparent, blue, black</li><li>Connections  USB 2.0 A cord 56.25” long</li><li>Aperture  F&#x2F;2 -

The Switch is one of Nintendo’s best-selling devices ever, despite hardware that lags behind the competition in terms of power. The Switch Lite builds on that success with similar hardware, complete compatibility, and an even more portable form factor.</p><p> Where the original Switch is a hybrid portable console, the Switch Lite is a more traditional handheld gaming device. It still provides most of the best features of the full-sized Switch, but it’s also Nintendo’s only pure portable since the discontinuation of the 3DS family of handhelds.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EUqklfDyxuB1ye8-DBboDrjzkUw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-2-225f5107c7b74f159afecba8c3f6174a.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Cute-and-compact"><a href="#Design-Cute-and-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Cute and compact"></a><strong>Design: Cute and compact</strong></h2><p> It’s hard not to swoon at the sight of the Switch Lite. The handheld console is cute and compact, featuring unique color options, bright white buttons, and joysticks wrapped around a downsized screen. The whole unit is about the size of a beefy phablet. The screen alone is about the size of an iPhone SE.</p><p> Compared to its larger cousin, this device is light and slim, with a smooth matte surface that spills across the entire unit in a beautiful, uninterrupted fashion. Whereas the regular Switch creates a stark contrast between each Joy-Con and the console, the Lite is one continuous body that creates a sleeker look and sturdier feel.</p><p> Looking at both Switches side-by-side, the Lite isn’t massively smaller in comparison, but it seems that way when you swap between the two. The reduction in size and weight doesn’t make it challenging to use for those with larger hands.</p><p> The screen has been decreased from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches, still sporting the same plastic overlay above it (meaning you’ll want to get a glass protector to prevent scratches), and the length and height have been trimmed down a good bit. The most obvious change here is the overall length of the Lite, which is slimmer by roughly the size of an entire Joy-Con on one side.</p><p> The smaller size is because the regular Switch has removable controllers, and the Lite does not. The compromise on its size is that you can’t take your Joy-Cons off and instantly start playing a local multiplayer game. Although that might be disappointing for some, the Lite now feels much better for long handheld gaming sessions when compared to the bulkier model.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p> Aside from the lack of removable controllers, the Lite features the same layout as the Joy-Con inputs, down to the spacing and functions. On the left are two shoulder buttons, a minus button (select), a joystick, a directional pad, and a screenshot button. The right side is mostly the same, with two more shoulders, a plus button (start), four inputs, another joystick, and a home button.</p><p> The only real notable difference here is that Nintendo has opted for a traditional D-pad, which is leagues better than the old layout for platformers, fighting games, and pretty much everything else. This distinction is, of course, because you’ll no longer be removing the left controller and requiring it to function as a separate device.</p><p> The top is home to the power button and volume toggle, a vent, a 3.5mm jack, and the game card slot, while the bottom holds the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> input for power and the addition of a new standalone SD card slot.</p><p> Where there’s usually a kickstand on the Switch with a hidden SD card slot, this version drops that option (since you can no longer remove the Joy-Con for tabletop mode) and adds a small door for expanding your storage. The kickstand was flimsy anyway, so you likely won’t miss it.</p><p> There’s still the issue with the USB-C port sticking straight out of the bottom, making it hard to sit flat against something, but this is somewhat less annoying since you’ll likely be holding it while gaming. Unfortunately, the Lite does not fit into the dock that came with a Switch. If you want to charge it, you have to plug it directly into the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-c-chargers-4155815" >USB-C charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the one on a regular Switch, as they’re the same.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7502vZ1Vh2D4nRux6hEnq4BL3Rk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-5-2fb7aa309cc54dd79c07bd799ef7fe84.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch"><a href="#Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Hit the switch"></a><strong>Setup Process: Hit the switch</strong></h2><p> If you’ve set up a previous Switch console in the past, the process here is mostly the same, but it’s even easier since there are no Joy-Cons.</p><p> Since the Lite is exclusively handheld, there’s no dock to worry about here, but make sure your console has enough juice before beginning setup. Setup starts with pushing the power button on the top and is facilitated by an on-screen guide that helps you set up the usual stuff like Wi-Fi, account creation (or login), etc. When complete, either pop in a game card or download one digitally to begin gaming.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> When you link your Nintendo account during setup, you can choose which Switch you want to be your primary system and which will be your secondary. That means that Nintendo essentially makes you decide to set up the Switch Lite as a secondary system that can only play your games while logged in and connected to Wi-Fi, or you can transfer the old Switch’s data to the new one.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> If you opt to make your Lite the secondary, you can kiss goodbye to playing any of your digital games on the go unless you have stable Wi-Fi on hand. Because of this, I decided to make my docked Switch the secondary (since it is always at home with Wi-Fi access).</p><p> While this does solve most of the issues, it’s annoying that it forces you to choose. Other systems, like Xbox, only allow one “home” console to play your games without being logged in, but it’s less of an issue since those consoles aren’t portable.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap). However, none of this data migration will happen automatically like other gaming consoles. You’ll need to manually download your saves locally each time and then update them on the console you want to use, even with the cloud option.</p><p> Sure, all of this does work, but it’s a pain to do and feels like another shortsighted attempt from Nintendo in a world where other competitors are leagues ahead. With other consoles and PC platforms like Steam, your saved data syncs to the cloud automatically, allowing you to play wherever you want without worrying about losing progress.</p><p> There’s yet another issue if you have kids or multiple accounts on your Switches. Since one Switch is now set as your primary, other users can’t access all your games from a secondary console.</p><p> For example, if you set the Switch Lite as your primary system, nobody can play games you’ve bought and downloaded on your home Switch unless they log into your account. You could always keep that other Switch as your primary, but then your Switch Lite will need Wi-Fi to access titles. It’s easy to see the problem there, but apparently, Nintendo doesn’t.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kQx9K3tATPBWAMgyJJymqBqYPao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-3-7349fa7d79f34dbaa50c25cb59aec820.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD"><a href="#Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD"></a><strong>Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD</strong></h2><p> Much like the original Switch, the Lite is by no means a powerhouse console sporting top-of-the-line graphics and hardware. That said, it doesn’t necessarily need to be. The Switch Lite performs similarly to its larger counterpart while in handheld mode, but let’s delve into specifics.</p><p> Sporting the same custom Tegra X1 from Nvidia, the Switch Lite has plenty of CPU and GPU power for its humble needs. The screen maxes out at a 720p resolution, which isn’t great but gets the job done on such a small screen. Since you can’t use the Switch Lite with a dock, there’s no way to play in 1080p.</p><p> Although the screen is reduced from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches on the Lite, I didn’t notice a big difference. The Lite’s display packs more pixels per inch (PPI) at 267 PPI compared to the original Switch’s 236 PPI. The display looks sharper, but with such a marginal difference, most won’t notice much.</p><p> I’ve played many games on the Switch Lite, including modern classics like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-4685759" >The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pokémon Let’s Go, and Shovel Knight. All these had a solid performance from the console, with no considerable dips in frames, hiccups, or freezes.</p><p> Like its predecessor’s mobile mode, the Switch Lite is unfortunately capped at 30 FPS for many titles (though it can hit 60 in some single-player games). Unlike the Switch, which you can dock to boost performance, you’re stuck with the handheld specs on the Lite.</p><p> A quick example is that single-player Mario Kart 8 Deluxe runs at a smooth 60 FPS in 1080p on a docked Switch but 720p at 60 FPS in the handheld mode. Adding more players reduces your frames to 30 FPS, which is also true for Smash Bros. The Switch Lite isn’t designed for single-device multiplayer, though, and you’re unlikely to get three or more players all crouched behind the 5.5-inch screen anyway.</p><p> These somewhat disappointing performance numbers look bad compared to a home console but remember that this is a handheld console that you can play for hours on end without needing a power cable.</p><p> If you’re like me and love to use the previous Switch in handheld mode for single-player games, the Lite will quickly become your go-to Switch for this particular setting. I’d even argue that this is perhaps the ideal way you should use it.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap).</p><p> Since the Switch Lite doesn’t have detachable Joy-Cons, you’ll need to bring an extra controller if you want to play local multiplayer games on the go. It works the same way as the original console, but it’s far less practical on the Lite since you can’t dock it, it doesn’t have a kickstand, you need separate controllers, and the screen is smaller. The option is there if you want, but this isn’t the Switch for you if you want to do local multiplayer.</p><p> Online multiplayer does, however, work pretty well. Boot up a game like Super Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., or your favorite free-to-play shooter and connect to the internet just like you would on the original Switch. For most matchmaking, however, you’ll need to pick up Nintendo’s online subscription service<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> This service is inexpensive at just $20 a year (or $35 a year for a family plan that allows up to eight users, also available at $4 a month), but many remain frustrated with its capabilities. It includes cool perks, like access to a growing library of NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games, the Nintendo Switch Online smartphone app, Save Data Cloud, and special offers for members.</p><p> Once again, there’s no Ethernet port, so you can stick with Wi-Fi and hope for the best or grab an aftermarket adapter, which is far less practical on the Lite, seeing how it’s handheld only.</p><p> Online games have worked well for me, despite needing to rely on Wi-Fi. However, Nintendo’s online service is still far behind the likes of Sony or Microsoft, and the lack of a wired connection means you may run into issues with speed and stability if your Wi-Fi isn’t great.</p><p> Frustrations like the lack of in-game chat cripple the Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo has done little to address these issues. Many functions still require you to use the app on your smartphone (like online voice chat), and while Xbox and PlayStation users get free games for their consoles as part of their subscription services, Switch users only get older virtual console games.</p><p> All said and done, the performance is excellent for single-player experiences on the Switch Lite, with online multiplayer trailing behind but perfectly functional. Local multiplayer is easily one of the biggest strengths of the original Switch and our favorite aspect. However, the methods used to create a more portable console with the Lite also severely hurt its viability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KxMaFgooi4rm3qbImmLKatuUtVI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-4-ef84dbbbde3d48ff97515e5c6b9981a4.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856"                      border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy"><a href="#Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy"></a><strong>Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy</strong></h2><p> If you’ve got an older Switch already or at least spent some time with one, the software found on the Switch Lite is exactly the same. Thankfully, that means it’s clean and snappy, but also a bit boring.</p><p> Booting up your Switch takes you to a quick start screen that allows you to either jump back into your recently used game or go straight to the main home screen by pressing the home button. This home screen provides a horizontal scrolling line of tiles for your games and apps, arranged by what you’ve recently used. Moving down to the lower row provides access to stuff like news, the eShop, screenshots, controller settings or the console’s settings.</p><p> Although you likely won’t be using Joy-Cons too often with the Lite, the bottom right will display your current controller setup so you know what’s connected. There’s also a handy little guide for what buttons you can use to interact with the options on screen. Up top, your profile and friends list can be accessed alongside a clock, a Wi-Fi meter, and a battery gauge.</p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld.</p><p> While the overall UI is quick and navigable, it feels drab. There are still no themes to swap aside from a simple light or dark mode, so don’t get too lofty with your customization ideas.</p><p> The biggest strength of the UI might be that you can use the touchscreen for most functions outside of games. Navigating the screen by tapping elements is even easier than using the controllers, and having an on-screen keyboard means typing out names and info is as easy as texting on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eFyBn6jL7cdHOO4q7zc6pALdQzw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-6-42a5bc5ea4e544bdb6d3fbbd074583c2.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best"><a href="#Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best"></a><strong>Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best</strong></h2><p> Battery life on the original Switch was just okay, to put it lightly, but typically you were lucky to get anything over 3 hours of screen time with most titles. It eventually received a bigger battery in a minor hardware revision, which helped. The Switch Lite has a slightly smaller battery than the revised Switch but also has lower power needs due to its small screen.</p><p> The Lite comes equipped with a 3,570mAh lithium-ion battery (compared to the 4,310mAh on the first Switch) that promises 3 to 7 hours of runtime. That extensive range exists because some activities on the console are far less demanding than others.</p><p> This slight bump in battery life is primarily due to the Switch Lite’s smaller screen, which needs less juice. Charging the battery takes about three hours, but only if you drain it completely. Using it occasionally instead of for extended gaming sessions, I’ve found that I don’t need to charge it that often and that it charges fast when I do.</p><p> Demanding titles like Breath of the Wild will still place you on the shorter end of that battery life spectrum, but I could log about 3.5-4 hours even with Zelda. Indie games and others that are less power-hungry can get you up to 5 hours and above. Note that you can tweak settings like brightness, Wi-Fi, and airplane mode to give even more screen time.</p><p> A portable charger is still one of the best accessories you can pick up for the Switch, and there are many quality options out that are approved by Nintendo. I recommend picking one up, but be careful which one you choose. I’ve stuck with reputable brands and haven’t had any trouble, but I have heard horror stories from people who have bricked their consoles with unsupported options.</p><p> Lastly, the battery is internal, so you can’t easily pop in a new one when it starts to degrade. While I haven’t seen any degradation with mine, it’ll happen at some point. When it does, sending it to Nintendo for repair is the only real option.</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands</strong></h2><p> It’s no surprise that since Nintendo removed many features from the Switch to create the Lite model, the price has also decreased considerably. The Switch is already at a pretty sweet price of $300, so how does the Lite stack up?</p><p> The Switch Lite has an MSRP of $200, which is a pretty good value. It plays all the same games as the original Switch at a significantly lower price and is much more portable. You do lose the ability to dock it; for some people, that feature will be worth the extra $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7XA6hgAK2B4hDSlWdmB8VQddrjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-7-Comparison-44dcf88ec51247a2b0756445a3c7884d.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch"></a><strong>Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch</strong></h2><p> The biggest competitor to the Switch Lite is the original Switch. Nintendo has done an excellent job with both of these devices, but they each have some strengths and weaknesses you should consider before buying.</p><p> The first thing to consider is whether you want to play couch co-op or versus with your friends. If you plan to use your Switch primarily for playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch. You need the original Switch to play on a larger screen, and it also comes with two Joy-Cons that you can use as separate controllers.</p><p> Even if you wanted to play with one other person locally on your Switch Lite, you’d need to spend about $60-70 on some Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller, thus nearly reaching the price of the full-sized console.</p><p> If you plan to use your Switch primarily for stuff like playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch.</p><p> If you feel like you’ll use your Switch away from home, or you’re primarily a solo player who plans to focus on single-player games or online multiplayer, the Switch Lite is equally good here. The main difference is that the Lite can only be used in handheld mode and takes a slight hit in resolution. The strengths of the Switch Lite are that it’s ultra-compact and portable, so if you mainly want something to take with you from place to place, it’s the better bet.</p><p> The Switch Lite also makes a great companion device if you already have a Switch. If you have both, you get the best of both worlds—the Lite’s portability and the regular Switch’s extra features.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Perfect for gamers who prefer handheld.</strong></p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld. It features an extensive library of exclusives that are perfect for a highly mobile system like Animal Crossing—and it’s hard to argue with the price.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-series-s-review-5085770" >Xbox Series S Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >Sony PlayStation 5 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Switch Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Nintendo</li><li>UPC  070004640519</li><li>Price  $199.99</li><li>Weight  9.7 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.6 x 8.2 x 0.55 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year warranty</li><li>CPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>GPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  32GB internal, one micro SD slot (up to 2TB)</li><li>Ports  USB-C, 3.5mm audio jack</li><li>Screen  Multi-touch capacitive touchscreen &#x2F; 5.5-inch LCD Screen &#x2F; 1280 x 720</li><li>Battery  Lithium-ion battery&#x2F;3570mAh</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-get-your-digital-dough-worthy-with-these-50-no-cost-youtube-promo-tools-for-2024/"><u>[New] Get Your Digital Dough Worthy With These 50 No-Cost YouTube Promo Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-streamlining-video-calls-leveraging-zoom-on-windows-10-pcs/"><u>[New] Streamlining Video Calls  Leveraging Zoom on Windows 10 PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-twitter-interactions-through-personalized-video-previews-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Twitter Interactions Through Personalized Video Previews for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-explore-the-10-most-inspiring-youtube-makeup-vloggers-ever-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Explore the 10 Most Inspiring YouTube Makeup Vloggers Ever for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-the-potential-of-minecraft-recording-with-macos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking the Potential of Minecraft Recording with MacOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-invisible-vids-on-social-reveal-the-top-12-techniques-to-restore-appearance-in-23/"><u>[Updated] Invisible Vids on Social?

This promises to be one of the most expansive and unique games in a long line of genre-defining titles with an enormous open world map and a wealth of engaging stories and activities to participate in. Valhalla builds on many of the mechanics players first saw in Assassins’s Creed: Origins and Odyssey, containing more RPG elements, a variety of combat styles, and plenty of upgrades.</p><p> I played the game on PC for several days, but it’s also available on all other major platforms including the upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/price-release-date-specs-xbox-series-x-5077092" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Xbox One, upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and PlayStation 4.</p><h2 id="Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled"><a href="#Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled" class="headerlink" title="Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled"></a><strong>Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to say here, but not much that can be said without spoilers. Given how engaging I found the plot, it would be a shame to spoil it in any way. Suffice it to say that, though it begins as a typical revenge story, it soon becomes more complex and interesting. You play as Eivor, a male or female warrior who raids England during the reign of Alfred the Great.</p><p> Aside from the basis in history, there are fascinating mythological elements to the storyline, and obviously, much attention was paid to crafting an authentic recreation of the cultures being represented here. The game does a good job of focusing on telling a story about Vikings, while also working the series namesake “Assassins” into the mix in a plausible manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pWujlWPf0ylYYpeoTEbp7X8U0yM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-4-07677871281c40a384f2df55f83e86a4.jpg"                      alt="AC Vallhalla 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Perhaps more interesting than the main plot are the side quests sprinkled liberally about the world. These are typically informal, chance encounters and, though they do grant experience towards skill points, their primary point is to tell an intriguing story, which they accomplish with aplomb. The characters are almost invariably well-acted, and while short, these quests are remarkably well written and worth seeking out.</p><p> The prologue map alone in Norway covers 15 square kilometers, and has between 10 and 15 hours worth of gameplay. It honestly is worth the cost of admission in its own right. I could easily have spent 20 hours there just climbing mountains. However, the core of the game is set in England, and the map is absolutely gigantic.</p><p> In total, the game’s various open world areas cover a staggering 140 square kilometers, nearly ten times the size of the prologue area. By this rough estimate, there should be at least 120 hours worth of content in this game, including a roughly 60-hour main campaign. Missions, mysteries, and treasure in abundance ensure that the wilderness never grows stale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vk4XvoE4lJwcjde1C_tJUVBc0Ac=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-9-a5e8ef2a5bef455d8cbaa9e749167f53.jpg"                      alt="AC sneak"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master"><a href="#Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master"></a><strong>Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master</strong></h2><p> Valhalla’s gameplay will be familiar to fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, particularly the more recent entries in the series. As usual, there are tweaks and innovations, but it was easy enough for me to pick up, with my most recent experience being with AC Unity. Players who’ve played Origins and Odyssey will find much to be familiar. The fluid movement and iconic parkour makes navigating around the expansive open world fun and engaging, though novices may accidentally fling themselves off a cliff or two by accident as they learn the ropes.</p><p> Fall damage is back, but don’t worry though, most falls won’t kill you, and you can just scarf a few berries and be right as rain. It’s worth the risk, as climbing mountains is in itself an activity that offers hours of freeform fun. As is traditional for Assassin’s Creed games, you can safely leap from any high place so long as there is a pile of hay, leaves, or a shallow pond to break your fall.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells.</p><p> There are traditional observation points to unlock, but there are also plenty of interesting peaks, spires, and mountain tops with unique views to discover. Most aren’t marked, so there’s a sense of discovery in seeking them out, and thanks to a robust photo mode, it’s fun to document your hiking and climbing adventures.</p><p> Traveling long distances around the map can be done via unlockable fast travel locations, but the vast, beautiful world crafted for Valhalla encouraged me to explore it on foot, even for paths I had trodden more than once. This is aided by your ability to summon a horse or a longboat to your position, either of which is an exciting way to travel.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells. Alternatively, your bard may accompany your seafaring with diverting tales. If there’s one downside is that unlike Odyssey, there’s no ship-to-ship naval combat, but perhaps that makes sense because the Vikings were more land raiders despite their extensive use of longboats to travel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/giaP-JV9QK6uFcdU_di4iWkvszw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-5-56a01de51a2a4540ae8650bece502873.jpg"                      alt="AC Valhalla 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Combat is fast, brutal, and varied with deep customization and different potential approaches. There are many ways to approach each situation, and none of them are wrong. You can sneak in and pick the enemy off one by one, dumping their carcasses in bushes so as not to tip off their friends, or you can nail them from a distance with arrows. Alternatively, you can stride in, axes twirling, and cut a bloody swath through your foes.</p><p> Skill points are given to you as you level up and can be used to upgrade your character and hone their skill in ranged, stealth, or melee fields. Abilities can also be discovered by reading books hidden throughout the world. This is the main way you can specialize your character build. If you want a more traditional assassin experience, put all your points into stealth or ranged, but if you want to live your life as a brutal Viking warlord, go all-in on melee. My favorite move is one in which you hurl throwing axes all around you in slow motion.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side. Even better are raids, where you leap from your ship among a horde of screaming Vikings to slay your enemies and loot their towns.</p><p> Raiding becomes a vital component of the game, as raids are the only way to build your settlement. It’s not a particularly complex base building mechanic, as it only involves raiding the requisite supplies and returning them to your settlement, whereupon a new building magically appears. It’s fun to watch your settlement grow, and you gradually unlock a variety of different functions and quests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n9S5L4JClTiqP1vYa_7cTGw6o0c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-7-d89d4a9941b8488ea6ef1aeba6486895.jpg"                      alt="AC ship"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize"><a href="#Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize" class="headerlink" title="Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize"></a><strong>Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize</strong></h2><p> Valhalla gives you plenty of ways to customize your experience.

I particularly enjoyed Flyting, which is a battle of words These are timed, competitive poetry contests where you must quickly select the most appropriate verse from a list of options. It’s both amusing and character building.</p><p> Orlog is an interesting dice game that I would honestly like to own in real life, and the drinking minigame is a highly enjoyable reflex-based challenge. A nice touch is that the results of imbibing huge amounts of mead persist for a period of time after the minigame is complete. After all, are you really a Viking warrior if you’re not completely drunk all the time?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/trRirIDsjFej03o-_HDCFsnnrzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-6-5449cde060b441a499a5189fda9a7a0a.jpg"                      alt="AC tattoos"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak"><a href="#Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak"></a><strong>Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak</strong></h2><p> As in Odyssey, the game allows you to play as either male or female, and offers a range of cosmetic options, mainly by way of tattoos and hairstyles. New tattoo patterns are acquired through parkour challenges. What’s more interesting is the gameplay affecting clothing and weapons that alter your appearance—I particularly appreciated that upgrading those items affects their looks. You can choose from different ravens and horses, and change the appearance of your longship. Eventually, you will also be able to customize the appearance of your settlement.</p><p> I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Epic-good-looks"><a href="#Graphics-Epic-good-looks" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Epic good looks"></a><strong>Graphics: Epic good looks</strong></h2><p> Valhalla is an absolutely gorgeous game. Everything from the detailed character models to the vibrant open world is beautiful to look upon. Changing weather alters the mood of landscapes, and can create breathtaking moments. I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><p> Towns and cities are richly detailed, with people going about their daily business in this muddy and gritty medieval setting. The wilderness is also magnificent, with wild natural beauty and towering ruins in equal measure. Wildlife and farm animals are both present in this world, adding vibrancy to the countryside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YazM4IIiw6qfR_cd-AfR8Cek9pg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-10-b813058de14c4b92978d22f84715ab98.jpg"                      alt="AC Mountain"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Performance: A rough start"></a><strong>Setup Process and Performance: A rough start</strong></h2><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla is typical of modern AAA titles in that it requires a big download and a considerable amount of storage space to house on your PC or console. With the day one update to consider, you’re looking at around 50GB.</p><p> Now, keep in mind that these are my pre-launch experiences with the game not fully patched. I initially installed it on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, which I reviewed recently and found to be capable of running modern titles at high or max settings. However, Valhalla appears to be a whole different kind of beast and played havoc on my machine.</p><p> When I first jumped into the game after the intro cutscene, I was greeted with the most horrendous graphics glitching I’ve ever experienced. Thinking this was because I had foolishly maxed the settings I restarted after tweaking down graphics, but upon restart, the glitches were appearing in the menu itself. I exited the game and the glitches persisted for about 10 seconds after Valhalla had closed. The built-in benchmarking tool in the game refused to run entirely. In the end, I decided not to push my luck with the laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R1pb8_CqlpJqAmK9Ka9-pgyOyJk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-3-ea07cee8afaa4cc89c4e2bb286b894a0.jpg"                      alt="AC ruins"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> On a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-pcs-4045451" >gaming PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an RTX 2070<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-graphics-cards-4692676" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , I didn’t encounter any glitches. However, the game is extremely power-hungry, and I was only able to run it at max settings with 60fps at 1080p. Ubisoft titles are known for being poorly optimized at launch, so this game should perform better after a few patches. Still, it’s clearly designed for next-gen consoles and the latest PC hardware. If you are playing on PC, be sure to utilize the benchmarking tool to find the ideal settings for your system.</p><p> Of course, if you’re playing on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you don’t have to worry about performance issues since the game is better optimized. It’s currently available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and will be available for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 at launch.

That will include the planned expansions which will add Ireland and France to the map. Expensive though $100 is, it does promise a potentially huge amount of content. The game also has microtransactions, which is a bit of a bummer, though these weren’t integrated into the game at the time of writing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/teY5MG-6xAT5sxNurIFy_iYPPvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-2-58ab82ef1f624e01b1c1c6dab8bca06b.jpg"                      alt="AC horse"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion"><a href="#Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion" class="headerlink" title="Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion"></a><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion</strong></h2><p> It’s interesting that Ubisoft decided to launch two third-person action games set in England within a span of a few weeks. Where Valhalla is set in the Middle Ages,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is set in a near-future sci-fi dystopia, though in both games you are battling against tyrannical rulers in England. Choose Watch Dogs if you want sci-fi focused on hackers and non-violent solutions, and Valhalla if you love bloody medieval fighting and exploration.</p><p> It’s also worth mentioning the resemblance between Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla to The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The comparison is inescapable due to the fact that both are based on Norse culture. While Valhalla is certainly a more historically grounded game as opposed to Skyrim’s totally fictional fantasy realm, Valhalla will nonetheless be familiar and exciting for fans of Skyrim.</p><p> Final Verdict: Epic stories and exciting combat in a sprawling open world.</p><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla exceeds, as Assassin’s Creed games so often do, in creating the most painstakingly detailed virtual recreation of a place and period possible. It’s got exploration, intense combat, and enthralling stories by the bucket full, and it’s easy to get lost in its sheer scope and scale. Just beware if you’re playing on a PC that will test the limits of your gaming rig.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (PC)</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Platforms  PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Stadia</li><li>Rating  M</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-cuddly-creatures-galore-best-android-wildlife-titles/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Cuddly Creatures Galore  Best Android Wildlife Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfect-propeller-synergy-for-awe-inspiring-fpv-flights/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfect Propeller Synergy for Awe-Inspiring FPV Flights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-tools-for-crafting-memorable-instagram-reels-top-6/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Tools for Crafting Memorable Instagram Reels (Top 6)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-sonic-artistry-and-video-prowess-in-sonys-xperia-xz/"><u>[Updated] Sonic Artistry and Video Prowess in Sony's Xperia XZ</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/1-step-by-step-guide-integrating-your-youtube-videos-with-imovie-for-seamless-editing/"><u>1.
