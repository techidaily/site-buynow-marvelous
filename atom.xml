Tasks are designed to help players improve their speed, perception, and cognition skills in first-person shooter (FPS) and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games.</p><p> After each task, Aimlabs offers players feedback and tips, game playback, and an accuracy heat map. Information gathered from each task is then used to suggest additional tasks. Lessons under the “Learn” tab work the same way.</p><p>Close </p><p> Because Aimlabs breaks down the action of aiming into these various skills, I finally understood exactly what aspects of my aim I needed to work on. Within just a few days of play, I saw improvement in my overall reaction time, my ability to hit moving targets, and in tactical movements such as wall peeking.</p><p> After a few weeks of training, my kill-to-death ratio in other games started to see some improvement as well. As with any skill, though, <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-access-6-leading-free-and-on-demand-youtube-short-downloader-tools/" >consistent practice is the key to success <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I had stopped playing for a few months, and there was a noticeable difference in my skill level when I returned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2-11.png"                      alt="An Aimlabs line graph showing task data results over time."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027181/19272" target="_top" id="2027181">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027181" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027181/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Science-Behind-Aimlabs"><a href="#The-Science-Behind-Aimlabs" class="headerlink" title="The Science Behind Aimlabs"></a>The Science Behind Aimlabs</h2><p> As its parent company explains, Aimlabs was created by “people who love gaming, who also happen to be neuroscientists, designers, developers, and computer vision pioneers.” This means that Aimlabs’ training plans and features are backed by scientific research and are curated by gamers, for gamers.</p><p> One feature that Aimlabs highly recommends players use is the Game Profile. This matches certain settings to that of whatever game you’re training for to help keep metrics uniform and give you the most accurate training scenarios possible. If you play <em>Valorant</em> or <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, this feature is even more important as Aimlabs has been named the official FPS training partner for both games.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-21-163112.png"                      alt="Aimlabs&#39; &quot;Controls&quot; page with the game profile set to Valorant."                > </p><p> When I first started playing Aimlabs, I opted to keep my game profile in the default Aimlabs mode since I was looking to improve my foundational skills. I only played general training tasks such as Reflexshot, which trains your precision by having you aim for targets that randomly appear in your field of vision. In this task, targets also increase and decrease in size based on your performance to keep you training at your threshold.</p><p> Now that I’ve advanced to game-specific training for <em>Valorant</em>, some of my most played tasks have been Valorant Ascent Tracking, which helps players track moving targets; VCT Fracture Operator, which trains players’ sniper skills; and VCT Latam, which hones players’ flicking and peeking skills.</p><p> Another setting that Aimlabs urges players to adjust is the mouse or controller sensitivity. I opted to do this through Aimlabs’s Flick Optimizer, which runs players through three tasks several times at different sensitivity levels and analyzes the results to find your ideal sensitivity.</p><p> Users who upgrade to the Aimlabs+ subscription ($12.99&#x2F;month) or purchase the ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition mouse can get further insights. However, the basic analysis will suffice for the majority of non-competitive players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-26_14h34_12.png"                      alt="Aimlabs&#39; &quot;Analyze&quot; page showcasing their sensitivity assessment options."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Aimlabs isn’t just about the right settings and solo training, though. Along with the official Aimlabs content, players can create custom tasks, weapons, and playlists. Additionally, you can collaborate with friends and create custom content to share with the community. Players are also able to compete against one another, either ranked or unranked, and you can track your progress through the community leaderboards.</p><p>Close </p><h2 id="How-to-Sharpen-Your-Shooter-Skills"><a href="#How-to-Sharpen-Your-Shooter-Skills" class="headerlink" title="How to Sharpen Your Shooter Skills"></a>How to Sharpen Your Shooter Skills</h2><p> To get started on your aim training journey, Aimlabs can be downloaded for free on PC through <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aimlabs/" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/aimlabs" >Epic Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/aimlabs/9p7cm8qnr6qh" >Xbox Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004444/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gg.statespace.aimlab&hl=en_US" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aim-lab-mobile/id1616550573" >iOS App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. As previously mentioned, users can opt to pay for an Aimlabs+ monthly, semi-annual, or annual subscription which provides more insights, the Discovery AI training engine which is replacing their ProGuides program, bonus Aimlabs Battlepass rewards, and more goodies.</p><p> That said, I’ve been very satisfied with the extensive free content provided, having only begun to scratch the surface of what Aimlabs has to offer. I highly recommend this training tool to anyone looking to build or sharpen your FPS and MOBA skills, regardless of which level you’re currently at.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-crafting-a-compelling-narrative-with-voiceover-and-visuals/"><u>[New] In 2024, Crafting a Compelling Narrative with Voiceover and Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-the-final-touch-youtube-outro-essentials-plus-premier-creator-list/"><u>[New] The Final Touch YouTube Outro Essentials + Premier Creator List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/aviation-gaming-the-ultimate-drone-race-course-and-best-models/"><u>Aviation Gaming The Ultimate Drone Race Course and Best Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/1723045760285-experience-enhanced-connectivity-with-synology-rt2600ac-wi-fi-router-parental-controls-included/"><u>Experience Enhanced Connectivity with Synology RT2600ac Wi-Fi Router: Parental Controls Included!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/1722829008339-exploring-the-handheld-joy-of-nintendos-switch-lite-budget-friendly-version-reviewed/"><u>Exploring the Handheld Joy of Nintendo's Switch Lite – Budget-Friendly Version Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/japanese-salutations-key-phrases-for-perfect-greeting/"><u>Japanese Salutations: Key Phrases for Perfect Greeting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/singing-machine-sml385btbk-karaoke-review-the-easiest-and-most-colorful-karaoke-machine-to-plug-and-play/"><u>Singing Machine SML385BTBK Karaoke Review: The Easiest and Most Colorful Karaoke Machine to Plug and Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-comprehensive-apple-tv-4k-2021-guide-revolutionizing-hd-streaming-with-siri/"><u>The Comprehensive Apple TV 4K 2021 Guide: Revolutionizing HD Streaming with Siri</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-and-evaluating-the-microsoft-surface-studio-2/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Understanding and Evaluating the Microsoft Surface Studio 2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/uninterrupted-snapstreaks-achievable-or-impossible-for-2024/"><u>Uninterrupted Snapstreaks Achievable or Impossible for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/1723862832268-unleash-next-level-graphics-on-the-cheap-innocns-stunning-240-hz-gaming-screen-for-just-199-grab-it-now/"><u>Unleash Next-Level Graphics on the Cheap – Innocn's Stunning 240 Hz Gaming Screen for Just $199 – Grab It Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-try-filmora-video-editor-and-download-this-powerful-and-intuitive-program-to-help-you-cut-trim-split-your-videos-for-2024/"><u>Updated Try Filmora Video Editor and Download This Powerful and Intuitive Program to Help You Cut, Trim, Split Your Videos for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037474/7443" target="_top" id="2037474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037474/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund/"><u>[New] In 2024, All You Need to Know About the YouTube Shorts Fund</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-recording-rivals-meet/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Recording Rivals, Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-path-for-macbook-pro-ssd-upgradation/"><u>A Step-by-Step Path for MacBook Pro SSD Upgradation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-elegance-in-ereading-a-detailed-review-of-the-amazon-kindle-2019/"><u>Affordable Elegance in eReading: A Detailed Review of the Amazon Kindle (2019)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/beat-time-learn-japanese-digits-fast/"><u>Beat Time, Learn Japanese Digits Fast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/bypassing-obstacles-a-guide-to-fixing-chatgpt-errors/"><u>Bypassing Obstacles: A Guide to Fixing ChatGPT Errors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-assessment-why-nintendos-switch-is-top-tier-portable-playtime/"><u>Comprehensive Assessment: Why Nintendo's Switch Is Top-Tier Portable Playtime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/effective-method-for-adding-music-to-facebook-iphone-for-2024/"><u>Effective Method for Adding Music to Facebook (iPhone) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/expert-tips-to-resolve-your-itbm-driver-availability-error-fast/"><u>Expert Tips to Resolve Your ITBM Driver Availability Error Fast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-realme-narzo-60x-5g-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Realme Narzo 60x 5G to Other Android Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-instant-anonymity-shield-face-details/"><u>In 2024, Instant Anonymity Shield Face Details</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-missing-features-in-samsung-galaxy-tab-a-2er-2020-review/"><u>In-Depth Look at Missing Features in Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2Er 2020 Review)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/mophie-powerstation-ac-review/"><u>Mophie Powerstation AC Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/next-gen-nomads-essential-travel-tech/"><u>Next-Gen Nomads: Essential Travel Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/sound-warriors-competing-titans-airpods-pro-and-galaxy-buds-pro/"><u>Sound Warriors: Competing Titans - AirPods Pro & Galaxy Buds Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-saving-images-from-word-doc-previews/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Saving Images From Word Doc Previews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-mastering-nikon-d7500-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Nikon D7500 for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Gaming-TV-in-2024"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Gaming-TV-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Gaming TV in 2024"></a>What to Look For in a Gaming TV in 2024</h2><p> Most modern TVs are pretty decent at gaming as manufacturers refine their products to better compete with computer monitors. Still, for great gaming performance, you need to look for specific components that the average TV may not have. These features make sure that your TV is future-proof and that you’re able to harness the best from the latest gaming consoles.</p><p> For example, while the input lag isn’t significant for every genre of gaming, it can be vital when you’re playing against others online. You want your input lag to be below 30ms, generally believed to be unnoticeable on TVs, and anything below 15ms is more than enough.</p><p> Variable refresh rate, or VRR, is another important feature as it reduces judder and screen tearing by ensuring that your TV can match its refresh rate with the frame rate of the gameplay. There are multiple VRR formats—<a class="link"   href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/" >AMD FreeSync, NVIDIA G-Sync <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/" >HDMI VRR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Knowing what your TV can handle in terms of VRR is important for a good gaming experience.</p><p> Next, <a class="link"   href="https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/" >Auto Low Latency Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or ALLM, is a nifty little feature that makes things more convenient. For example, the TVs with ALLM can receive a signal from a console or computer when you are playing a game, so it should switch on the “<a class="link"   href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-much-income-arises-from-each-snapshot-video-for-2024/" >Game Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.” It’s not a necessary feature, but one that’s really great to have, especially for the amount you’re shelling out for a gaming TV.</p><p> Lastly, 4K resolution at a 120Hz refresh rate has become a big deal over the last year as the latest consoles from Microsoft and Sony support it. So, if you want to play games in 4K resolution at up to 120fps, your TV should have an HDMI 2.1-capable port. And, since the <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/" >HDMI 2.1 specification <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> guarantees support for the ALLM and VRR, you can expect to see both of those features as well.</p><p> Apart from these gaming-specific features, you’ll also want your TV to be great at other tasks, like offering a top-notch visual experience and fantastic sound quality.

As it has a native 120Hz refresh rate, you can enjoy smooth 4K gaming on both consoles. Besides, the TV supports features of both consoles, including variable refresh rate, Dolby Vision for gaming, and more.</p><p> PS5 owners also get access to the Auto HDR Tone Mapping feature on the A95L that seamlessly adjusts the TV settings to deliver the best HDR performance, whether you are using the console to play games or watch a Blu-ray. Moreover, the Auto Genre Picture Mode can automatically trigger the TV’s Game Mode when you start playing a game on PS5.</p><p> The Multi View feature of the TV will also come in handy when you need to watch a walkthrough or tutorial next to your game in challenging levels. Thanks to the low input lag, games feel responsive, and instant response time helps deliver clear motion.</p><p> Picture quality is a highlight of the A95L as the included 4K <a class="link"   href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solved-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-keeps-crashing/" >QD-OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> panel produces breathtaking visuals with inky blacks and vibrant colors.

So, if you utilize the eARC port to connect to a soundbar, you will get only one free HDMI 2.1 port to connect a console or gaming PC. It’s an annoyance but not a deal-breaker.

However, you can also play your favorite games without connecting a console or PC to the QN90C, as the Samsung Gaming Hub gives you access to cloud gaming services such as <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-av1-versus-vp9-the-ultimate-codec-showdown/" >Amazon Luna <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, NVIDIA GeForce Now, and <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-cinematic-illumination-a-filmmakers-path-to-stunning-colors/" >Xbox Cloud Gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Although all QN90A models with a screen size of <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Anti-Glare-Q-Symphony-QN50QN90C/dp/B0BTTVL419/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208970&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/749603/best-gaming-tvs/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >55 inches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and higher have a 120Hz ADS-style display panel, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Anti-Glare-Q-Symphony-QN50QN90C/dp/B0BTTVZT1G/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208970&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/749603/best-gaming-tvs/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >43-inch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Anti-Glare-Q-Symphony-QN50QN90C/dp/B0BTTVJPLG/ref=asc%5Fdf%5FB0BTTVJPLG/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208970&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/749603/best-gaming-tvs/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >50-inch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models use a 144Hz VA-type panel. So, the 43-inch and 50-inch models don’t have wide viewing angles but a slightly higher refresh rate.

But it’s cheaper to get 4K resolution on a large screen via a TV compared to a monitor.

The company promises regular content updates, too, which could help your kiddo avoid boredom with seeing the same stuff over and over.</p><p> “NickWatch is a true disruptor in the wearable tech category for kids, combining world-class Nickelodeon content with unrivaled parental controls and features,” said Udi Miron, CEO at Watchinu,<a class="link"   href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/watchinu-brings-award-winning-nickelodeon-smartwatch-for-kids-to-the-us-302195353.html" >in a statement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . “We are bringing to market a smartwatch that is not only fun and enriching, but will grow with the children who wear them for years to come.”</p><p> The idea is to empower your kids’ independence while keeping them safe, of course, and the NickWatch app offers a subscription ($8 - $13 per month) to do just that with location tracking and communication tools. You can also create an area you want your kids to stay in (a geofence) and get a notification if they go past those boundaries. Parents and caregivers can even mute the watch during school hours and manage who can chat with their kiddo on the watch.</p><p> The NickWatch will retail or $119. It will be available at Walmart.com Saturday, July 13, and should appear in Walmart stores starting in October.  </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/nickWatch-by-nickelodeon/6344272802" >$119 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-smartwatch-8666142" >5 Things to Consider Before You Buy a Smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-keeping-score-with-your-xbox-one-screenshots/"><u>2024 Approved Keeping Score with Your Xbox One Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/all-encompassing-clarification-the-basics-of-googles-podcast-platform/"><u>All-Encompassing Clarification The Basics of Google's Podcast Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/an-in-depth-review-how-the-outer-worlds-blends-fun-with-futuristic-fiction/"><u>An In-Depth Review: How 'The Outer Worlds' Blends Fun with Futuristic Fiction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/before-you-invest-in-a-fitness-band-these-5-aspects-are-crucial/"><u>Before You Invest in a Fitness Band, These 5 Aspects Are Crucial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/1723209397631-corsair-keyboard-dilemma-solved-now-sparklingly-lit/"><u>Corsair Keyboard Dilemma Solved – Now Sparklingly Lit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/high-fidelity-mp4-streamer-to-facebook-for-2024/"><u>High-Fidelity MP4 Streamer to Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/how-to-master-flying-with-the-economical-syma-107g-hobbyist-rc-helicopter/"><u>How to Master Flying with the Economical Syma 107G Hobbyist RC Helicopter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-convert-kings-playbook-youtube-to-mp4mpeg-edition/"><u>In 2024, The Convert King's Playbook YouTube to MP4/MPEG Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-speedy-pics-viewing-tool/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Speedy Pics Viewing Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-realme-narzo-n55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Realme Narzo N55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-nhl-19-digital-gaming-experience/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of NHL '19' Digital Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-mobvois-latest-the-ticwatch-pro-3-with-gps-and-extended-dual-screen-life-reviewed/"><u>In-Depth Look at Mobvoi's Latest: The TicWatch Pro 3 with GPS and Extended Dual Screen Life Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/leveraging-tv-platforms-for-facebook-live-viewership/"><u>Leveraging TV Platforms for Facebook Live Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/soaring-to-new-heights-an-in-depth-review-of-djis-mavic-3-for-advanced-aerial-photographers/"><u>Soaring to New Heights: An In-Depth Review of DJI's Mavic 3 for Advanced Aerial Photographers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/stand-stronger-on-your-ergohead-mat-in-depth-analysis-of-durability-and-comfort-for-prolonged-use/"><u>Stand Stronger on Your Ergohead Mat: In-Depth Analysis of Durability & Comfort for Prolonged Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-comprehensive-review-of-toshibas-fire-tv-edition-a-must-have-screen-for-amazon-prime-enthusiasts/"><u>The Comprehensive Review of Toshiba's Fire TV Edition -

The unit is thoroughly water-resistant, making a day at the ocean or laps at the pool no cause for worry.</p><p> Measuring about 1.5 by 1.5 inches, the touchscreen is easy to wake at any time with the innate ‘screen wake’ feature. If you prefer, you can easily modify the settings to only wake when you press the side button or touch the screen, or you can set it to stay on continually.</p><p> With a host of different color options, wristbands, and downloadable clock faces, the Fitbit Versa Lite is a stylish digital watch that’s ready to be customized.</p><p> The Fitbit OS has an intuitive interface and is easy to navigate.

The Fitbit app is available for both iOS and Android platforms, and syncing it to the Versa Lite via Bluetooth is very straightforward.</p><p> When you connect your watch to the app the first time, the touchscreen guides you through a series of “Quick Tips” to get you acquainted with the Versa Lite’s layout. The whole process takes about 10 minutes and then you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BD_8kRJ7n6qQdf5LY9rLKiYigTQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-05-fac178f5e6b240c29ff8d1e1e4fcb96f.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability"><a href="#Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability"></a><strong>Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite feels nice in your hands and on your wrist. The device is relatively lightweight at 1.41 ounces and the screen unit sits naturally on the back of your wrist. The Versa Lite comes with two wristbands, one small and one large, measuring four and 5.25 inches long. Both are a little less than an inch wide and are made of a smooth, soft polymer material which is very comfortable for extended periods of wear.</p><p> Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed.</p><p> Aesthetically, the Versa Lite’s screen and wrist band are attractive and look sleek. You can confidently wear the Versa Lite in any professional setting—it’s good-looking but not overly flashy. Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed and you might find yourself wanting to leave it on the bedside table instead.</p><h2 id="Performance-Lean-and-effective"><a href="#Performance-Lean-and-effective" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Lean and effective"></a><strong>Performance: Lean and effective</strong></h2><p> The Versa Lite uses an optical heart rate monitor which applies photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure your pulse and gauge your heart rate. This feature shines a rapidly-pulsating LED into your skin and measures how your blood flow affects the dispersion of light, producing a constant stream of heart rate data.</p><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite also has sleep monitoring features, so if you choose to sleep in the watch, the Fitbit app will be able to tell how much time you spend in light, deep, and REM stages as well as more accurately measure your resting heart rate. This is especially useful for rigorous exercise training, such as training to race a marathon or set a PR. Sleep tracking is activated by a combination of complete rest and changes in your heart rates patterns, known as heart rate variability (HRV).</p><p> Despite lacking the extra bells and whistles of Fitbit’s more advanced models (such as Fitbit Pay and music storage capabilities), the Versa Lite has all the features any walker, runner, biker, swimmer, weightlifter, or fitness enthusiast will want for goal-setting and training. It does have a few smartwatch features like a weather app and call and text notifications, as well as the Strava fitness app. But it does not have cellular connectivity on its own, and can only display notifications when connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth.</p><p> Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit.</p><p> The GPS capabilities of the Versa Lite are limited in a similar way. The smartwatch does not have full GPS capabilities, so it approximates your distance and pace by measuring your stride length with its built-in step counting technology. If you want this data to be relatively accurate, you’ll have to take your phone along with you so the watch can use what Fitbit calls “connected GPS” to access your smartphone’s GPS signal. Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit compared to the data our other GPS-capable watches collected.</p><p> The Versa Lite has specific modes for running, biking, swimming, walking, treadmill workouts, weight lifting, and interval workouts. These exercise apps chart your workouts and allow you to customize a real-time display of your stats in order to get you the updates you want in the middle of your workout. For instance, the Versa Lite can notify you at predetermined ‘lap’ distances (such as mile intervals) to give you your average mile pace while in “Run” or “Walk” mode. You can easily customize these different stats in the exercise app settings.</p><p> The Versa Lite is water-resistant and rated at a depth of 50 meters, so you can swim with it on and take advantage of its swim mode exercise app. The swimming app brings up one of the flaws we found with our particular Versa Lite: it wouldn’t turn off! There are recent reports on the Fitbit.com forum of some users encountering a strange phenomenon where the swim mode won’t stop when you press the pause and finish buttons.</p><p> It is unclear how many users are affected by this glitch (it seems other users are unaffected) but we experienced it with the Versa Lite Edition we tested. The only way for us to exit the swim exercise app was to hold down the side button for about 10 seconds in order to escape with the factory power cycle feature. This was one of the only significant flaws we found with the Versa Lite, but it did mean that all data for the swim workout was lost after restarting the Fitbit. This essentially rendered the swim mode unusable on our unit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/97XADSG__Ti-9y6W9YfT6A-sRLg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-04-a5baf62c5de749cb93986be2eab3ad2d.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Days-of-activity"><a href="#Battery-Life-Days-of-activity" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Days of activity"></a><strong>Battery Life: Days of activity</strong></h2><p> Fitbit promised four or more days of battery life for the Versa Lite, and they weren’t lying.

These stats include daily step count, total distance covered for the day, daily calorie consumption, active minutes for each day, and a Saturday through Friday graph of your average daily steps.</p><p> A host of other smartwatch apps come standard with the Versa Lite, including alarms, a weather app, a stopwatch, a relaxation app that guides you through short mindfulness exercises, and the specific exercise apps mentioned above. As far as additional apps for the Versa Lite, this is it—the Lite Edition does not have the ability to add extra apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134499/19576" target="_top" id="2134499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134499/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-deal-for-under-200"><a href="#Price-A-deal-for-under-200" class="headerlink" title="Price: A deal for under $200"></a><strong>Price: A deal for under $200</strong></h2><p> Retailing for $159.95 and occasionally selling for less on sale, the Versa Lite is a price-conscious but solid piece of tech that prioritizes exercise. It’s a great introduction to the smartwatch lifestyle with all the notifications you need to be connected and without an overwhelming amount of distractions.</p><p> The ability to train in-depth with the Fitbit app and various Versa Lite exercise apps makes this fitness tracker a pretty good deal for under $200. Avid swimmers, on the other hand, may want to look elsewhere.</p><h2 id="Fitbit-Versa-Lite-Edition-vs-Apple-Watch-Series-4"><a href="#Fitbit-Versa-Lite-Edition-vs-Apple-Watch-Series-4" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Versa Lite Edition vs. Apple Watch Series 4"></a><strong>Fitbit Versa Lite Edition vs. Apple Watch Series 4</strong></h2><p> Fitbit and Apple have fundamentally different business models, but one thing is certain: the Fitbit Versa Lite wins in the price category and accomplishes all the key health monitoring features of the Apple Watch Series 4.</p><p> The Versa Lite, and the Versa family in general, are Fitbit’s main venture into the smartwatch market. Relying heavily on the Fitbit app for its design and integration, the Versa Lite is focused on delivering a targeted dashboard of stats for its users, including Fitbit’s core stats like step counting and calorie counting.</p><p> The new Apple Watch on the other hand, as per Apple’s brand identity, is more geared to synchronizing and integrating with the lives, apps, and products of those already accustomed to the iPhone and Mac brand. In addition to this, Apple’s new Series 4 watches have been redesigned with wellness monitoring features like heart rate tracking and step counting.</p><p> The Apple Watch carries a heftier price tag at $399 (MSRP) without cellular connectivity. If you are not already hooked on the Mac lifestyle or love to accessorize your digital life with apps, the Fitbit Versa Lite should be a worthy consideration for anyone looking to get a quality fitness tracker and well made first-tier smartwatch.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An adept and affordable fitness tracking smartwatch for those who want to keep it simple.</strong></p><p> Though we can’t recommend this watch to swimmers (pending a potential software solution for that glitch), the Fitbit Versa Lite is a great way to chart your progress throughout a training program or competitive season. The combination of the Fitbit Basics and dedicated exercise apps makes this watch both an insightful wellness monitor for everyday activity and a great tool for tracking your fitness progress.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-forerunner-945-review-4768586" >Garmin Forerunner 945 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-inspire-hr-review-4768656" >Fitbit Inspire HR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-review-4766873" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151865/7443" target="_top" id="2151865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151865/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Versa Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>MPN  FB415</li><li>Price  $159.95</li><li>Weight  1.41 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android, Windows 10</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth 4.0, Bluetooth LE</li><li>Battery  1 x lithium polymer battery (included)</li><li>Battery capacity  Up to 4 days</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Display  LCD touchscreen</li><li>Heart Rate Monitor  Yes</li><li>Memory Capacity  7 days of activity data, 30 days of daily totals</li><li>What’s included  Fitbit Versa Lite Edition watch, small wrist band, large wrist band, USB charging cradle</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-early-bird-shooters-guide-to-cams-of-24/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Early Bird Shooter’s Guide to Cams of '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfecting-music-in-instagram-videos-and-stories/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfecting Music in Instagram Videos & Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/caixuns-4k-android-tv-with-a-75-inch-screen-a-great-value-for-the-price/"><u>Caixun's 4K Android TV with a 75-Inch Screen -

a Subwoofer in 2023"></a>What to Look For in a Subwoofer in 2023</h2><p> Low frequencies are comparatively uncommon in nature, and when we do hear them, they’re usually a sign of danger. Thunderstorms, earthquakes, and landslides are some reasons you’d hear this low-frequency range in the natural world. Because of this, they’re exciting.</p><p> Adding a subwoofer to your home theater setup makes movies and music feel more impactful because of the way our bodies respond to these lower frequencies. Adding a powerful subwoofer to your home audio setup makes a much bigger difference than turning up the bass on your A&#x2F;V receiver or soundbar.</p><p> Low frequencies are harder to reproduce than higher frequencies because of the size of the waveforms. This means you need a larger speaker to reproduce lower frequencies, so subwoofers often have speakers 12 inches or more in diameter. That said, you’ll find an eight-inch subwoofer can be surprisingly powerful.</p><p> Because of the size of the speakers, subwoofers tend to take up a fair amount of space. Some companies build low-profile subwoofers that can hide away under a couch, for example, but these are tougher to build, so you’ll find they’re often more expensive than traditional, cube-shaped subwoofers.</p><p> Most subwoofers are also powered, meaning they don’t require an external amplifier, but they do need to be plugged into a wall outlet. Typically, you’ll also need to run a cable from your A&#x2F;V receiver or soundbar to the subwoofer. Wireless subwoofers are available, though you’ll often find them packaged in home-theater-in-a-box or soundbar systems.</p><p> While most subwoofers will work equally well for music or movies, you’ll want to remember how you plan to use them. Smaller subwoofers often work fine for home theater systems, but you might need a larger subwoofer to keep up with floor-standing hi-fi speakers, for example.</p><p> Finally, subwoofers for your vehicle are almost an entirely different category. These often need to be more shallow to easily mount in a car, and they often don’t come in a bespoke speaker cabinet.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

While it only packs an eight-inch woofer, it provides powerful bass, and you can put it almost anywhere.</p><p> The Bluesound Pulse SUB+ features a slim, low-profile design that makes it easy to find a home for, no matter how large or small your living room might be. Slide it under your couch to keep it out of sight, or place it in the perfect spot for room-filling bass. No matter what, it won’t be in the way.</p><p> Looking at the audio performance, the Pulse SUB+ packs 150 watts of power, with digital signal processing (DSP) to ensure perfect audio. This is a solid wattage to start from in the first place, but the DSP makes this subwoofer sound much bigger than the wattage and woofer size would have you imagine.</p><p> One minor downside of the Bluesound Pulse SUB+ is that it doesn’t include a hardware remote.

It doesn’t take up too much space, and even though it only packs 60 watts, it brings some serious low-end audio to your audio.</p><p> The Monoprice 60-Watt Powered Subwoofer might only have an eight-inch driver but can still produce frequencies as low as 50 Hz. If you’re using smaller speakers for the rest of your system, the crossover goes up to 150 Hz, meaning the subwoofer can handle the entire low-end audio spectrum without any help from your other speakers.</p><p> If you’re using an A&#x2F;V receiver that doesn’t have a proper subwoofer output, there’s no need to worry. This model takes a standard RCA left&#x2F;right connection, you can use a standard line out, which the subwoofer will combine into mono for the bass signal. You can also take a standard speaker output from the front left and front right channels and use that.</p><p> This being a budget option, you’re not going to find an exotic wood used for the cabinet.

An amplifier that Klipsch refers to as “all-digital” provides 200 watts of continuous power and up to 400 watts of peak power. The cabinet comprises half-inch MDF side panels, with a .75-inch front panel and center bracing for a tough enclosure.</p><p> Connectivity options may look limited with the R-121SW, as there is only one pair of RCA inputs on the back. However, this pair of inputs doubles as the line-in and LFE inputs, depending on whether you use one or both terminals. This means one fewer jack on the back than most subwoofers, but it makes for a slightly cleaner look.</p><p> To ensure the subwoofer is as compatible as possible, Klipsch has equipped it with a crossover knob, adjustable from 40Hz to 120Hz, while turning it up all the way enables the LFE input. A gain control joins this to adjust the maximum volume and a switch to invert the phase, which can solve problems in certain stereo and home theater setups</p><p> There aren’t any color options, just the standard Klipsch black and gold. Still, this is a color scheme that can fit in almost anywhere, regardless of your decor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/klipsch-r-121sw-thumb.png"                      alt="Klipsch R-121SW"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052060/7443" target="_top" id="2052060">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052060" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052060/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best 12-inch Subwoofer</p><h5 id="Klipsch-Reference-R-112SW-1"><a href="#Klipsch-Reference-R-112SW-1" class="headerlink" title="Klipsch Reference R-112SW"></a>Klipsch Reference R-112SW</h5><p>The Klipsch Reference R-112SW may fit in well with the company’s other speakers, but it’s meant to work with any speakers, amp, or receiver you own.

There aren’t any satellite speakers or complicated connectivity. You get the soundbar itself and the wireless subwoofer, which is pre-paired, so you don’t even need to struggle with this part of the process.</p><p> The Cinema 600 is a 3.1-channel soundbar, and there isn’t any support for more complex audio channel setups, like Dolby Atmos. Fortunately, the soundbar does feature 5.1-channel decoding, but you won’t hear the rear surround channels. You connect the soundbar to your TV via HDMI ARC, and there is no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity.</p><p> Looking at the subwoofer itself, this is a 10-inch model, so it offers up plenty of bass. The good news is the subwoofer is level adjustable, so if you find the bass is overpowering or too subtle, you can adjust it to your personal preference.</p><p> Klipsch complements the simplicity of the Cinema 600 sound bar with a classic look. Unlike many soundbars, this is constructed out of real wood. This not only makes for a very solid build, but it’s also an aesthetically pleasing design choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/41yhsv9efol-_sl500_.jpg"                      alt="41yhsv9efoL._SL500_"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975802/19272" target="_top" id="1975802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975802/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Soundbar with Subwoofer</p><h5 id="Klipsch-Cinema-600-Sound-Bar-3-1-1"><a href="#Klipsch-Cinema-600-Sound-Bar-3-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Klipsch Cinema 600 Sound Bar 3.1"></a>Klipsch Cinema 600 Sound Bar 3.1</h5><p>The Klipsch Cinema 600 Sound Bar 3.1 is a soundbar with all the boom you need, courtesy of the 10-inch subwoofer and 600 watts of power.

These frequencies are harder to reproduce, so a dedicated speaker lets your other frequencies focus on midrange and high frequencies.</p><h3 id="Where-should-I-place-a-subwoofer"><a href="#Where-should-I-place-a-subwoofer" class="headerlink" title="Where should I place a subwoofer?"></a>Where should I place a subwoofer?</h3><p> You can place a subwoofer nearly anywhere, and it will work. Typically, putting it either near your sitting position or near your TV are two common choices. Putting your subwoofer in a corner can make it sound lower.</p><h3 id="How-do-I-test-a-subwoofer"><a href="#How-do-I-test-a-subwoofer" class="headerlink" title="How do I test a subwoofer?"></a>How do I test a subwoofer?</h3><p> Your home theater system or A&#x2F;V receiver often has a test function that will play white noise through every speaker connected, including your subwoofer. You can also watch the cone of the speaker, assuming it’s visible, to see if it’s moving. Another option is playing some music, starting at a low volume, then raising it to see if you can hear the subwoofer working.</p><h3 id="How-do-I-connect-a-subwoofer-with-a-sound-bar"><a href="#How-do-I-connect-a-subwoofer-with-a-sound-bar" class="headerlink" title="How do I connect a subwoofer with a sound bar?"></a>How do I connect a subwoofer with a sound bar?</h3><p> Many subwoofers connect wirelessly to the subwoofers they come with, so there’s no need to make a connection manually. For a wired subwoofer, you’ll typically run a supplied cable from the soundbar to the subwoofer.</p><h3 id="How-do-I-connect-a-subwoofer-to-a-receiver"><a href="#How-do-I-connect-a-subwoofer-to-a-receiver" class="headerlink" title="How do I connect a subwoofer to a receiver?"></a>How do I connect a subwoofer to a receiver?</h3><p> Receivers connect to subwoofers via a few methods. The first is an RCA cable, running from the Subwoofer output on your receiver to the input of a subwoofer. For a passive subwoofer, you’ll find typical speaker jacks, labeled Subwoofer, on your receiver or integrated amplifier. Connect the subwoofer to this with speaker wire.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-quick-fixes-for-perfect-ipad-screenshots/"><u>[New] Quick Fixes for Perfect iPad Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/outhful-youtuber-writers-handbook-creating-channels-clutching-cash/"><u>[New] Youthful Youtuber’ Writers’ Handbook Creating Channels, Clutching Cash</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-guaranteed-method-to-keep-youtube-shorts-out-of-sight/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Guaranteed Method to Keep YouTube Shorts Out of Sight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-concealed-visibility-mastering-visual-obscurity-in-videos/"><u>[Updated] Concealed Visibility Mastering Visual Obscurity in Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-voice-command-technology-for-efficient-ppt-creation/"><u>2024 Approved Voice Command Technology for Efficient PPT Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/binge-eating-disorder/"><u>Binge Eating Disorder;</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-evaluation-of-the-rca-video-doorbell-camera-for-modern-homes/"><u>Comprehensive Evaluation of the RCA Video Doorbell Camera for Modern Homes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/explore-high-flying-entertainment-at-home-with-the-syma-107g-mini-rc-helicopter-a-cost-effective-way-to-fly/"><u>Explore High-Flying Entertainment at Home with the Syma 107G Mini RC Helicopter: A Cost-Effective Way to Fly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/get-to-know-the-newly-launched-cycwagen-e-bike-with-a-comprehensive-interactive-review/"><u>Get to Know The Newly Launched CycWagen E-Bike with a Comprehensive, Interactive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/24-how-to-animate-and-make-your-own-effects/"><u>In 2024, How to Animate and Make Your Own Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-logitech-c615-webcam-analysis-balancing-cost-and-quality/"><u>In-Depth Logitech C615 Webcam Analysis - Balancing Cost & Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-e2-assessment-affordable-yet-disappointing-value/"><u>Mobvoi TicWatch E2 Assessment: Affordable Yet Disappointing Value</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/small-code-improvements-or-big-leaps-in-functionality/"><u>Small Code Improvements or Big Leaps in Functionality?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-google-pixelbook-go-masterful-execution-challenging-price-tag/"><u>The Complete Guide to the Google Pixelbook Go - Masterful Execution, Challenging Price Tag</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/the-easy-way-to-remove-an-apple-id-from-your-macbook-for-your-apple-iphone-15-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>The Easy Way to Remove an Apple ID from Your MacBook For your Apple iPhone 15 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/what-is-screencasting-and-how-to-choose-the-right-screencasting-software-in-2024/"><u>What Is Screencasting and How to Choose the Right Screencasting Software, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-your-oneplus-open-auto-does-not-work-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>What To Do if Your OnePlus Open Auto Does Not Work | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

I had seen pictures and videos of the console and the spec sheet, but I was still surprised at how compact this thing was when I unboxed it. It’s smaller than the Xbox One S, and Microsoft bills it as “our smallest Xbox ever.” That’s especially noteworthy since Microsoft and Sony went exceptionally big with their flagship consoles, the Series X and PlayStation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3-mUIkkRYilM5F2tvCYMPXtW1Ew=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1-04d996bcdfbb489d84e8945e4c475713.JPG"                      alt="Xbox Series S"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> The overall form factor of the Series S is similar to the Xbox One S, but the Series S lacks an optical drive and includes a massive circular vent on one side. This striking design choice has drawn comparisons to a speaker and a washing machine. It also bears a passing resemblance to Microsoft’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-xbox-adaptive-controller-4707753" >adaptive controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is boxy, white, and features two large black circular pads. This aesthetic might not be for everyone, but I like how it stands next to my television.</p><p> Aside from the bold vent grill, the Series S doesn’t break any new ground regarding design choices. It has sturdy rubber feet on two sides, so you can lay it flat or stand it up on end, as has become more or less standard with home consoles. It feels pretty sturdy in both positions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948881/19272" target="_top" id="1948881">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948881" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948881/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easier-than-ever-before"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easier-than-ever-before" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easier than ever before"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easier than ever before</strong></h2><p> Game consoles are usually pretty easy to set up, but the Xbox Series S takes that to the next level. Start by connecting the console to a television with an HDMI cable and plugging it into power. When you turn the Series S and the TV on, you get an invitation to set up the console with the Xbox app or do it the traditional way.</p><p> Optimized titles, like Gears of War 5, looked decent on my 1080p television and great upscaled on my 4K television.</p><p> I highly recommend setting up the Xbox Series S with the help of the Xbox app. It massively streamlines the process, makes it easier to connect to Wi-Fi since you don’t need to type out your password with the Xbox’s on-screen keyboard, and even pre-loads the Series S with settings from your old Xbox One if you had one.</p><p> I ended up wiping the console back to factory settings a few times while I put it through its paces, so I also tried the traditional setup method after circling back. It’s similar to setting up an Xbox One; not that difficult or time-consuming, but the app option is better.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151892/7443" target="_top" id="2151892">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151892" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151892/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Rock-solid-1440p-gaming"><a href="#Performance-Rock-solid-1440p-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Rock solid 1440p gaming"></a><strong>Performance: Rock solid 1440p gaming</strong></h2><p> The Xbox Series S is a bit of a mixed bag in the performance department because of its stripped-down hardware. The CPU is similar to the more expensive Xbox Series X, but the GPU is significantly weaker<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-teraflop-5076877" >in teraflops (TFLOPs) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and has less RAM.</p><p> In cutting back on the Series S hardware to meet its attractive price point, Microsoft targeted a resolution of 1440p at 60 or 120 FPS. A handful of games like Hades and The Touryst render in 4K at 60 FPS, while poorly-optimized games like Cyberpunk 2077 struggle and most games run best in 1080p.</p><p> I’ve used the Series S with 1080p and 4K televisions and found the graphics decent and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optimizing-video-game-frame-rates-811784" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rock solid in most cases. Most games run better in 1080p, but 4K upscaling also worked well in my experience.</p><p> If you have a 1440p monitor, that’s ideal, as that’s the console’s default resolution, but it worked fine when connected to my 1080p and 4K televisions.</p><p> Developers can optimize Xbox One games and Xbox Series X|S games to take advantage of the more powerful hardware. During my initial time with the Series S, I played a handful of titles optimized for Xbox Series X|S and one Xbox Series X|S game.</p><p> Optimized titles, like Gears of War 5, looked decent on my 1080p television and even better upscaled on my 4K television. Gears of War 5 played buttery smooth, with no noticeable FPS fluctuation as I slid between taking cover and mantling over obstructions to chainsaw enemies.</p><p> Load times were negligible in each of the games I played, which is expected from a system with super-fast NVME SSD storage.</p><p> Another optimized title, Forza Horizon 4, looked and played great, though it was weird to see ghosts of my friends dating back to the game’s original release populate my races on the Xbox Series X|S version.</p><p> Post-launch titles have run the gamut. Cyberpunk 2077 was disappointing initially, with a capped frame rate and dynamic resolution. I ended up playing it on a PC instead, but the devs did go back later and add a performance mode that bumped it up to 60 FPS at the cost of a lower resolution. At the other end of the spectrum, I was pleasantly surprised when Hades ran in native 4K, and it felt just as fluid and frenetic as it ever did on PC.</p><p> Load times were negligible in each game I played, which I expected from a super-fast NVME SSD storage system. Some games had more noticeable load times than others, but not enough to disrupt gameplay.</p><h2 id="Games-Microsoft-still-has-an-exclusivity-problem"><a href="#Games-Microsoft-still-has-an-exclusivity-problem" class="headerlink" title="Games: Microsoft still has an exclusivity problem"></a><strong>Games: Microsoft still has an exclusivity problem</strong></h2><p> You won’t have any shortage of games to play on the Xbox Series S, especially if you’re a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-game-pass-4178809" >Game Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> subscriber. I predicted that the Series S would be the ultimate Game Pass machine at release, and that prediction has borne fruit in my home, at least.</p><p> Microsoft’s game subscription service provides hundreds of games to download and stream, including major day-one releases from first-party studios, and that’s how my Series S has seen most of its use.</p><p> Full backward compatibility meant you could play every Game Pass game on day one. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-exclusive-games-xbox-series-x-5079143" >Xbox Series X|S launch lineup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was robust, with titles like Gears of War 5 re-tuned specifically for Xbox Series X|S and brand-new games like Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Dirt 5, and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla ready to go. Hundreds of additional titles have bolstered that lineup since then, like Halo Infinite and Psychonauts 2.</p><p> The catch with the Series X|S game library is that all Microsoft first-party console exclusives are also on PC. That means anyone with a decent gaming rig can play the same exclusives as the Xbox Series S. That’s meaningless to anyone who doesn’t own a gaming PC, but it does take a bit of shine off the console from the perspective of a PC gamer.</p><p> A handful of games like Hades and The Touryst render in native 4K at 60 FPS, while poorly-optimized games like Cyberpunk 2077 struggle, and most games run best in 1080p.</p><p> Other consoles, like the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, have games you can’t get anywhere else, while the Xbox Series X|S has timed exclusives and console exclusives. That isn’t a knock against Microsoft, as the availability of Xbox exclusives on the PC is fantastic for computer gamers. Still, it does put Xbox consoles in a tough spot compared to consoles from other manufacturers.</p><p> Microsoft’s $7.5B purchase of Bethesda’s parent company, Zenimax, brought some hope of additional exclusives appearing in Microsoft’s arsenal. (Bethesda is the publisher of Fallout, DOOM, Dishonored, Skyrim, Wolfenstein, The Elder Scrolls, and more.) However, the situation is murky as the company has yet to clarify which (if any) Bethesda titles will be exclusive to Xbox.</p><h2 id="Storage-Disappointingly-shallow-so-bring-your-USB-drive"><a href="#Storage-Disappointingly-shallow-so-bring-your-USB-drive" class="headerlink" title="Storage: Disappointingly shallow, so bring your USB drive"></a><strong>Storage: Disappointingly shallow, so bring your USB drive</strong></h2><p> The biggest problem with the Xbox Series S is the lack of storage. Unlike the Series X, which packs in a 1TB drive, the Series S only offers 512GB of space. That’s an extremely shallow pool to swim in when dealing with an all-digital console, as you have to download every game you play.</p><p> Wanting to see how my Guardian looks on next-gen hardware, Destiny 2 was one of my first downloads, and I almost immediately regretted it. At over 100GB, Destiny 2 ate nearly one-fifth of the total storage space on the console. Unable to find a USB drive that I could format, I sucked it up and deleted the game to make room for titles that had been optimized or designed for the Xbox Series X|S.</p><p> Even then, space became an issue quickly, and I sacrificed the drive I typically use with my PS4. Moving games is, thankfully, a breeze. However, I could not move the Xbox Series X|S games to the drive because it was too slow. The moral of the story is that if you pick up a Series S, make sure you have a fast USB drive on hand or get used to playing musical chairs with your onboard storage.</p><p> For me, the solution has been to use the Series S primarily as a Game Pass machine. Since Game Pass lets you stream games instead of downloading them, the restrictive storage issue becomes less of a concern.</p><p> For those who need more space, the Series S has a slot on the back for a storage expansion card, a proprietary storage device designed to be just as fast as the built-in NVME SSD. The issue is that it’s expensive. You can get a USB 3.1 SSD of a similar capacity for less than half as much, so most price-conscious Series S owners will probably gravitate in that direction. However, Microsoft gives the raw I&#x2F;O bandwidth of the drive, and presumably the expansion card, as 2.4 GB&#x2F;s, which is almost twice as fast as USB 3.1.</p><p> So if you go with an external USB drive, you’ll only be able to play Xbox One, Xbox 360, and original Xbox games stored on it.</p><h2 id="Internet-Connectivity-Fast-when-wired-but-Wi-Fi-is-a-mixed-bag"><a href="#Internet-Connectivity-Fast-when-wired-but-Wi-Fi-is-a-mixed-bag" class="headerlink" title="Internet Connectivity: Fast when wired, but Wi-Fi is a mixed bag"></a><strong>Internet Connectivity: Fast when wired, but Wi-Fi is a mixed bag</strong></h2><p> With all those massive games and the fact that the Series S is a digital-only console, you will spend a lot of time downloading. The Series S has built-in Wi-Fi and an Ethernet port, so you have options, but a wired connection is the way to go here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_GSxQvNgtJMhoyNl62qlg671Qvo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2-25991056c5c2486695923f7c1b61c7b5.JPG"                      alt="Xbox Series S"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> When downloading over Wi-Fi, I rarely saw over 150Mbps (compared to the 350Mbps I measured on my HP Spectre x360 laptop in the same room and at the same time). Curiously, the Series S download speed tanked, down to the lower double digits, while I was running speed tests on my laptop. Similarly, download speeds dive into the low teens whenever a game runs, even in the background.</p><p> When connected via Ethernet, the Series S reported 880Mbps down and 65Mbps up on the network status screen. That’s right on the money in terms of what I see directly at my Eero router. Actual download speeds topped out at 500Mbps and typically hung out between 270 and 320Mbps.</p><p> The bottom line is that the Series S provided fairly unimpressive download speeds over Wi-Fi but tore it up when connected via Ethernet. You’ll want to connect this all-digital console via Ethernet to a fast internet connection.</p><h2 id="Software-and-User-Interface-Familiar-and-cozy"><a href="#Software-and-User-Interface-Familiar-and-cozy" class="headerlink" title="Software and User Interface: Familiar and cozy"></a><strong>Software and User Interface: Familiar and cozy</strong></h2><p> Microsoft isn’t looking to rock the boat with the Xbox Series X|S in terms of the user interface. If you’ve used an Xbox One, you’ll find the Xbox Series X|S user interface strangely familiar. The dashboard looks almost the same, and the guide functions as expected. There are a few upgrades and changes here and there, but this is nothing like the massive change between the Xbox 360 dashboard and the Xbox One dashboard.</p><p> An overhaul of the dashboard is currently in the works, and we expect it to arrive in 2023.</p><h2 id="Controller-Iteration-more-than-innovation"><a href="#Controller-Iteration-more-than-innovation" class="headerlink" title="Controller: Iteration more than innovation"></a><strong>Controller: Iteration more than innovation</strong></h2><p> The Xbox Series X|S controller is a pleasant surprise, as Microsoft also chose to stick with a winning formula. The original Xbox One controller was well-received, and its minor facelift with the release of the Xbox One made it even better. Microsoft took that design for the Xbox Series X|S and tweaked it ever so slightly.</p><p> The overall shape of the Xbox Series X|S controller is quite similar to the Xbox One controller. The dimensions aren’t identical, but it’s tough to pick them out with the naked eye. The most notable difference I noticed was that the body of the Xbox Series X|S controller is a bit thicker when viewed head-on. The battery compartment is also slightly smaller.</p><p> Since the Series S supports most Xbox One peripherals, owners don’t have to worry about the added expense of buying extra controllers.</p><p> The most significant addition to the controller is that it now includes a dedicated share button. Snapping screenshots and recording video wasn’t difficult on the Xbox One, but adding a dedicated button makes it that much easier.</p><p> The D-pad has also changed, with the Xbox Series X|S controller adopting the faceted single-piece design previously seen in Xbox One Elite controllers. It feels nice, if different, but only time will tell if it’s more robust than previous iterations. The triggers and bumpers also received a facelift that ditched the glossy finish and added some nice texturing.</p><p> Aside from that, the only other item of note is that the Xbox Series X|S controller includes a fairly aggressive texture on the grips that feels quite nice when held.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MZdEnnFWPzhGzv_P5GO8byAY5qI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3-dd9458b294e74205acad2ff6fee33913.JPG"                      alt="Xbox Series S"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Price-Jaw-droppingly-low"><a href="#Price-Jaw-droppingly-low" class="headerlink" title="Price: Jaw-droppingly low"></a><strong>Price: Jaw-droppingly low</strong></h2><p> Pardon me for burying the lede, but the price of the Xbox Series S is the actual headline here. The Series S has an astoundingly low MSRP of just $299. Additionally, you can buy one by paying just $24.99 per month for two years, including access to Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p> Whether you buy a Series S outright or use Microsoft’s Game Pass inclusive financing option, this is a tremendously affordable console. The Series S undercut the Xbox One S at launch, though Microsoft later discontinued the previous-gen consoles. The Xbox One X currently has an MSRP of $499, so it’s pretty clear what Microsoft is doing here.</p><p> One nice thing about the Xbox Series X|S is that when you buy a new console, you typically have a bunch of add-ons to worry about that drive the price up. For example, you might have to purchase several controllers to support multiplayer, which adds up to $60 or more per controller. Since the Series S supports most Xbox One peripherals, owners don’t have to worry about the added expense of buying extra controllers.</p><p> One expense you may need to budget is a high-speed USB 3.1 drive. The console is perfectly usable without an external drive, but expect to uninstall games regularly to make more space if you limit yourself to the onboard storage.</p><h2 id="Xbox-Series-S-vs-PS5-Digital"><a href="#Xbox-Series-S-vs-PS5-Digital" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Series S vs. PS5 Digital"></a><strong>Xbox Series S vs. PS5 Digital</strong></h2><p> This comparison is a bit of an unfair fight because Microsoft and Sony took entirely different approaches when designing their lower-priced console options. Microsoft cut back on hardware to offer an incredibly low price point, while Sony removed the optical drive. The result is that the PS5 Digital blows the Xbox Series S out of the water in terms of graphics and performance, but they aren’t even in the same time zone in terms of price.</p><p> The PS5 Digital is essentially the same console as the PlayStation 5, which has similar specifications and performance to the Xbox Series X. It’s capable of 4K HDR graphics at 60 and 120 FPS, and the Series S can’t touch that with its pared-down GPU.</p><p> On the other hand, the Xbox Series S has an MSRP of just $299, while the PlayStation 5 Digital sells for $399. Rumors indicated that Sony might have gone even higher in price but cut it as far as possible to remain competitive.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An affordable alternative for those without a 4K television.</strong></p><p> The Xbox Series S might be a bit of a step back from the Xbox One X in performance, but the fact is that it’s a next-gen console that plays next-gen games with some impressive hardware and an unreal price tag. Gamers in search of the best graphics possible will want to look at the Xbox Series X instead, but gamers who haven’t yet made the 4K plunge, parents in need of an affordable console for their kids, or anyone looking to save money will all find something to like here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044586/7443" target="_top" id="2044586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044586/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >Sony PlayStation 5 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-lite-review-4788015" >Nintendo Switch Lite Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox Series S</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>SKU  RRS-00001</li><li>Price  $299.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  4.25 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.5 x 15.1 x 27.5 cm.</li><li>Color  White</li><li>CPU  8 core AMD Zen 2 CPU @ 3.6GHz (3.4GHz with SMT)</li><li>GPU  AMD RDNA 2 GPU 20 CUs @ 1.565GHz</li><li>RAM  10GB GDDR6</li><li>Storage  512GB PCie Gen 4 NVME SSD</li><li>Expandable Storage  1TB expansion card, USB 3.1 drives</li><li>Ports  3x USB 3.1, 1x HDMI 2.1</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-a-step-by-step-technique-for-instagram-savings-for-2024/"><u>[New] A Step-by-Step Technique for Instagram Savings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-complete-igtv-user-manual/"><u>[New] The Complete IGTV User Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-your-sound-with-the-compreenas-complete-morphvox-guidebook/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Your Sound with the Compreenas Complete MorphVOX Guidebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/chatgpt-plus-is-it-a-smart-investment-top-5-benefits-of-joining-now/"><u>ChatGPT Plus: Is It a Smart Investment?

class="headerlink" title="What to Look For In a Solar Charger in 2023"></a>What to Look For In a Solar Charger in 2023</h2><p> Before we get into what makes for a good solar charger, let’s clear up what we mean by “solar charger” since it’s distinct from concepts like a “solar power bank” or “solar panel.”</p><p> A solar charger is a device that converts solar power using solar panels into an electric current suitable for charging devices, usually in the form of a USB power port conforming to USB power specifications.</p><p> Solar chargers typically don’t have any power storage of their own, but you can use the charger with a power bank of your choice. In general, putting a lithium battery in direct sunlight is not a good idea, so it makes sense that most solar chargers don’t integrate them. Instead, you’d use a lengthy cable to connect devices under shade or in your bag, protected from direct sunlight.</p><p> It’s important to use a solar charger with the necessary safety circuitry to prevent device damage. In models with poor safety controls, too much voltage may go to the device, damaging it. The charger may also keep pushing charge to the device even though it’s full. So look for mention of overcharge protection and other similar features.</p><p> If you do use a charger that doesn’t explicitly mention these features, it’s usually a better idea to charge up an inexpensive power bank, rather than charge your tablet, phone, or other devices directly. Then use the power bank to charge your devices in turn.</p><p> Size, weight, and mounting features are other key considerations. Small, foldable, and light solar chargers are more common now. Despite their size, they can produce usable amounts of power thanks to advancements in solar panel efficiency. Chargers may come with backpack mounts, kickstands, frames, or other mounting solutions. It’s best to pick one that matches your use case.</p><p> For higher-capacity chargers, it’s always nice to have multiple ports to charge several devices simultaneously. Weatherproofing is a must since the odds of it raining at some point are virtually assured.</p><p> Finally, an oft-overlooked feature is “auto resume.” Many solar chargers will stop charging when the sunlight drops below a certain level, and then fail to resume unless you manually reinsert the charging cable. Chargers with auto-resume ensure you don’t come back after a few hours to find that your device stopped charging ages ago.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>5</td><td>24</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It is great for smartphones, tablets, powerbanks, laptops, mini power stations, and other daily electronic devices that you may need indoors, outdoors, or even during an emergency situation or power outage.</p><p> Unlike some solar chargers, the FlexSolar Solar Charger features an 18W USB-A (QC 3.0) port as well as an 18W USB-C port, and a DC port. These allow for more versatile charging options for all your mobile devices when you’re out and about. This also helps you pack light by reducing the number of chargers you travel with and eliminates the need for a <a class="link"   href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/" >USB-C to A cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> It is also foldable and portable for hiking and other outdoor adventures. Weighing 2.86lbs, the charger is relatively heavy, but can easily fit into your backpack. And if you want it to charge as you go, hook it up to your backpackvia the built-in carabiners, and you’re good to go. However, note that this type of charging may be slow and unoptimized.</p><p> The FlexSolar 40W Solar Charger has a charging status indicator and a smart charging feature that automatically detects devices and delivers optimal charging for each connected device. It also comes with overcurrent, overheating, and short-circuit protection, ensuring safe charging at all times.</p><p> With an IP67-rating, the FlexSolar 40W Solar Charger is dustproof and water-resistant, which is great for different outdoor weather conditions. However, note that the junction box is not waterproof, so ensure to keep it away from wet spots. To top it off, the FlexSolar 40W Solar Charger also has an auto restart feature in case clouds or other coverings interfere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/flexsolar.png"                      alt="flexsolar"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Solar Charger Overall</p><h5 id="FlexSolar-40W-Solar-Charger-1"><a href="#FlexSolar-40W-Solar-Charger-1" class="headerlink" title="FlexSolar 40W Solar Charger"></a>FlexSolar 40W Solar Charger</h5><p>$79 $100 Save $21 </p><p>Let the sun charge your smartphone, power bank, and most other 5V USB-powered devices with this foldable and efficient portable solar charger.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/FlexSolar-Portable-Waterproof-Foldable-Compatible/dp/B09H6GGK55/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202922&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/865817/best-solar-chargers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$79 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Budget-Solar-Charger-BLAVOR-10W-Portable-Solar-Charger"><a href="#Best-Budget-Solar-Charger-BLAVOR-10W-Portable-Solar-Charger" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Solar Charger: BLAVOR 10W Portable Solar Charger"></a>Best Budget Solar Charger: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BLAVOR-Portable-Waterproof-Compatible-Backpacking/dp/B0BJDBQXQ3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202922&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/865817/best-solar-chargers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >BLAVOR 10W Portable Solar Charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BLAVOR-Portable-Waterproof-Compatible-Backpacking/dp/B0BJDBQXQ3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202922&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/865817/best-solar-chargers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLAVOR-Portable-Waterproof-Compatible-Backpacking/dp/B0BJDBQXQ3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202922&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/865817/best-solar-chargers/&asc_campaign=Commerce"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BLAVOR-solar-charger.jpg"                      alt="BLAVOR solar charger on backpack"                > BLAVOR</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BLAVOR-Portable-Waterproof-Compatible-Backpacking/dp/B0BJDBQXQ3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202922&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/865817/best-solar-chargers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Foldable, waterproof, dustproof</td><td>✗ Low wattage for slow charging</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Can charge two devices at 5W 2A max</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BLAVOR-Portable-Waterproof-Compatible-Backpacking/dp/B0BJDBQXQ3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202922&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/865817/best-solar-chargers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Blavor 10W portable solar charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a robust, foldable solar charger that offers just enough juice to keep a typical smartphone topped up.

If you’re worried about the panel being stolen, and if your vehicle is standing the sun, you can even stick it on the inside of a car’s window.</p><p> The Eco-Worthy has safety features to prevent it from overcharging your car battery, or discharging it overnight when it’s not getting sunlight. The panel is waterproof as well, so no worries about rain!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/eco-worthy-1.png"                      alt="eco-worthy-1"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Solar Car Charger</p><h5 id="ECO-WORTHY-12-Volt-10-Watt-Solar-Car-Battery-Charger-1"><a href="#ECO-WORTHY-12-Volt-10-Watt-Solar-Car-Battery-Charger-1" class="headerlink" title="ECO-WORTHY 12 Volt 10 Watt Solar Car Battery Charger"></a>ECO-WORTHY 12 Volt 10 Watt Solar Car Battery Charger</h5><p>$22 $43 Save $21 </p><p>If your vehicle isn’t near an outlet for a traditional trickle charger and you don’t want to spend your first moments reuniting with your undriven vehicle ordering a new battery, this solar battery maintainer from Eco-Worthy is an essential purchase.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/ECO-WORTHY-Portable-Battery-Charger-Batteries/dp/B017K6PH1S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202922&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/865817/best-solar-chargers/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$22 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112008/7443" target="_top" id="2112008">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112008" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112008/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Can-you-charge-a-solar-charger-without-sunlight"><a href="#Can-you-charge-a-solar-charger-without-sunlight" class="headerlink" title="Can you charge a solar charger without sunlight?"></a>Can you charge a solar charger without sunlight?</h3><p> Solar chargers don’t store energy, and they need sunlight to produce electricity, so sadly, you can’t use them without sunlight.</p><h3 id="Do-solar-chargers-charge-on-cloudy-days"><a href="#Do-solar-chargers-charge-on-cloudy-days" class="headerlink" title="Do solar chargers charge on cloudy days?"></a>Do solar chargers charge on cloudy days?</h3><p> Yes!

The volume buttons on the earbuds control only the PS Link audio, so when your earbuds are connected to a Bluetooth device, volume is solely controlled from that device. This also means that when listening to two audio sources from both PS Link and Bluetooth devices at the same time, the volume button on the earbuds controls only the PS Link audio.</p><p> Battery life maxes out at a paltry five hours, with an additional five hours from the charging case, for a maximum of 10 hours, although both times can be slightly improved with lower listening volumes. The Pulse Explore earbuds take about 40 minutes to charge from empty, although just 10 minutes of charging can get you about 1.5 hours of battery life.</p><h2 id="Sound-and-Immersion-Best-with-PlayStation"><a href="#Sound-and-Immersion-Best-with-PlayStation" class="headerlink" title="Sound and Immersion: Best with PlayStation"></a><strong>Sound and Immersion: Best with PlayStation</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/2024-06-29-11-33-26.jpg"                      alt="Sony PlayStation Portal, Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds, and Charging Case on a tabletop"                > </p><p>Bill Loguidice &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> There’s no question what systems the Pulse Explore earbuds are optimized for. When playing on a PS5 or PS Portal, the sound is perfectly tuned, with excellent stereo separation and proper surround effects that really let you hear what direction they’re coming from. A good amount of bass is present, but it’s never overpowering and gives the overall sound profile some heft. Whether playing a racer like “Trials Rising,” an action-stealth adventure like “Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,” an action-adventure like “Horizon Forbidden West,” or a sports game like “MLB The Show 24,” I always felt immersed and that the Pulse Explore were delivering an ideal audio experience.</p><p> Of course, the premium sound from the Pulse Explore is not too unexpected as they feature planar magnetic drivers typically found only in larger over-the-ear headphones. This technology improves clarity and detail, and it’s definitely put to excellent use here, justifying the relatively higher cost of these earbuds. Even at maximum volume, the Pulse Explore remain distortion-free.</p><p> The microphone is also an excellent performer, clearly capturing my voice with no noticeable distortion. While Sony promises AI-enhanced noise rejection, I did find some outside noises, particularly if I held the controller close to my face or typed on my mechanical keyboard, to creep in.</p><p> Unfortunately, since there’s no active noise cancellation, you’re at the mercy of how well the earbuds fit in your ear to block out any outside noise. While I felt like I found the right tips, and thus had the best possible fit, I never felt like outside noises were blocked out in quite the same way they would be with good active noise cancelation. With that said, the passive noise cancelation is certainly usable, with only louder external noises making it through.</p><p> When connected to my Windows 11 PC via the USB adapter, I found the sound profile to be middling, with some slight muddiness. By default, it’s a bit too bass-heavy for my liking, and, since there’s no software specific for Pulse Explore for PCs, you’re left to the sound tuning options that are built into Windows or Mac. It’s not bad sound by any means, but it’s a bit of a let-down in comparison to what Sony has pulled off with its own PS5 and PS Portal systems.</p><p> Of course, nothing is stopping you from using your own PC Spatial Sound options. For instance, I have both Windows Sonic for Headphones and Dolby Atmos for Headphones installed on my PC, and, while not perfect, do work well enough with the Pulse Explore. I’d say these are roughly in the league of the <a class="link"   href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-guide-to-recording-presentations-using-webcam/" >ROG Cetra True Wireless SpeedNova <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in terms of PC sound quality, but far below something like the <a class="link"   href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-6s-with-a-mask-on-drfone-by-drfone-ios/" >Logitech G Astro A50 X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In short, while these are perfectly usable, if you want these primarily for PC gaming, even with the low latency PS Link connection, you’re better off looking at more PC-specific options for richer sound profiles and more customization.</p><p> Nevertheless, as with the ROG Cetra True Wireless SpeedNova, I do appreciate how quickly I can use the Pulse Explore USB adapter to switch the sound to the Pulse Explore Earbuds from the regular speakers on my PC. Similarly, I also like how I can listen to something on my Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max while also listening on my PC.</p><p> In terms of the iPhone and other mobile devices, I tried the Pulse Explore over Bluetooth and I preferred the default sound profile over what I experienced on a PC. While a slight bias towards bass was still there, I found the overall sound profile to be cleaner. I wouldn’t consider these a replacement for my Apple AirPods Pro, but there’s no denying these sound good when used as regular Bluetooth headphones, including when having to use the microphone.</p><p> Finally, it’s important to note that the only device you can permanently adjust the equalizer, sidetone volume, 3D audio, and other settings for the Pulse Explore is when connected to a PS5. Equalizer and sidetone volume settings are stored on your earbuds once you configure them through your PS5 console. If you connect your earbuds to other devices, they’ll keep the same settings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915825/19272" target="_top" id="1915825">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915825" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915825/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Fit-Bulky-and-a-Bit-Odd"><a href="#Design-and-Fit-Bulky-and-a-Bit-Odd" class="headerlink" title="Design and Fit: Bulky and a Bit Odd"></a><strong>Design and Fit: Bulky and a Bit Odd</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/2024-06-29-10-49-56.jpg"                      alt="Sony Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds in a person&#39;s hand"                > </p><p>Bill Loguidice &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Each earbud features a volume up and down button at the top and PS Link buttons at the bottom. When both the left and right earbuds are connected via PS Link, the left earbud’s microphone is enabled. As is the problem with many earbuds with physical buttons, and something a company like Apple solves with their AirPods by simply doing away with any tactile controls, is the tendency to hit the volume buttons when inserting the Pulse Explore earbuds in your ear. It’s hardly a deal-breaker, and I certainly appreciate the ability to quickly adjust the volume, but it nevertheless leads to inadvertent presses when inserting or adjusting the earbuds.</p><p> Another thing to note is that there’s no in-ear detection with the Pulse Explore, so your audio won’t pause when you remove the earbuds. Just like with the lack of wireless charging for the charging case, Sony chose to focus their efforts on core functions and sound quality rather than some of the more nice-to-haves, but not strictly necessaries, found on competing devices.</p><p> The Pulse Explore charging case has the same white and black design aesthetic as the PS5 and PS Portal, but with an odd mailbox shape that’s the opposite of pocket-friendly. Overall, it’s like something out of a previous generation of products, but perhaps more understandable when considering the relative size of the earbuds. What’s not understandable is why, given the relative size of the charging case, there is no storage compartment for the PS Link USB-A adapter.</p><p> The earbuds themselves are similarly bulky, with an unbalanced shape that’s a bit hard to get used to. Once you pick the earbud tip that provides the best fit and seal, you insert the earbuds with a slight upward twist so the PlayStation logo is level. Although there’s no active noise-canceling, with the right tip, external noises should sound muffled, with audio at the same level in each ear. It took some practice for me to get used to the awkward shape and more consistently insert the earbuds correctly into my ears. Once inserted properly, however, I found the earbuds to be comfortable.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Sony-Pulse-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Sony-Pulse-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Sony Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds?"></a><strong>Should You Buy the Sony Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds?</strong></h2><p> If you want good multi-platform gaming earbuds, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds/" >Sony Pulse Explore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> make a nice choice. They have the best sound when used with the PS5 or PS Portal, where they’re well-tuned with excellent surround sound performance, but also do well with Bluetooth devices, and a serviceable job on PCs.</p><p> If you’re a PS Portal owner, these are all but a must-buy as only these are one of two compatible wireless options. With its more portable form factor, the Pulse Explore makes a stronger choice for most users, and thanks to Sony’s use of magnetic planar drivers, the sound quality can rival that of over-the-ear headphones with that same type of technology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sony-pulse.png"                      alt="Sony Pulse"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/htg-staff-pick-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134228/18498" target="_top" id="2134228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134228/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Sony-Pulse-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds-1"><a href="#Sony-Pulse-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds-1" class="headerlink" title="Sony Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds"></a>Sony Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds</h5><p>7&#x2F;

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s also an HDMI output and a 3.5mm audio jack that handles audio-in and out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RkOepytb4JglYF6g8lqap4lR4Uk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-5-b8c978f2d42a4865be1ea11a4785c104.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> All the laptop’s ports are placed near the front of the chassis. You’ll have to deal with tangled cables more often than with a laptop that places most ports on the rear. I found this annoying when using an external mouse, as cables jutting from the laptop’s flanks often bumped my hand while playing games.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-This-one-is-special"><a href="#What’s-New-This-one-is-special" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: This one is special"></a>What’s New: This one is special</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has little in common with other Predator Triton or Helios models. A few common design elements can be found in the speaker grill, fans, and PreadtorSense software, but the design is otherwise distinct.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Better-than-first-glance"><a href="#Display-Better-than-first-glance" class="headerlink" title="Display: Better than first glance"></a>Display: Better than first glance</h2><p> I wasn’t immediately impressed by the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s display. It’s not especially bright and has a matte coating, so lacks the brilliant, eye-catching look that is common to high-end laptops with glossy, high-brightness displays.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played.</p><p> Once I loaded a game, though, I liked what I saw. The screen’s resolution is 1080p, but that’s more than enough to provide a sharp, crisp look in modern games. It also supports a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984" >maximum refresh rate of 144Hz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , providing an ultra-smooth look in older titles capable of achieving a high framerate.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played. Games with bright, high-color graphics look vivid, while those with a moody tone look dark and foreboding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eRv5Q4rKutM9zrhSTCRxbBO4rVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-6-2af7f9999ae847bda4f5b9b830c9c555.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> There’s one downside: poor viewing angles. This is unusual in a modern laptop, though I’ve noticed this trait in many high-refresh laptop displays. I can’t give the Triton 300 SE too much flak for this given its otherwise excellent performance.</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else"></a>Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s most unusual feature is its Intel Core i7-11375H processor. It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493. The Geekbench 5 multi-core score is behind the curve;<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >new AMD Ryzen 7 5000-series laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can almost double that result. This will disappoint content creators who use CPU-dependent applications. The Acer Triton 300 SE won’t keep up with AMD-powered rivals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, in such workloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_blPSVdy574t15clSGhbK6JH68o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-4-5a097b76e29b4ee985eee421ed6d0fe8.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> Gaming performance proved more impressive. 3DMark Fire Strike hit a score of 14,462, while Time Spy hit a score of 6,721. The laptop averaged 143 FPS in the GFXBench Car Chase test. It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives. When compared to all gaming laptops, this Acer delivers great performance for the price.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution. I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse. Key feel is good, with significant key travel and firm bottoming action, and the spacious layout will be comfortable for most users.</p><p> There is a flaw: some keys are smaller than they could be. The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples. It’s an odd decision that can cause confusion when hunting for a keyboard shortcut.</p><p> Keyboard backlighting is standard and set to white by default, but the color can be customized across three zones. It’s not as impressive as the per-key RGB backlighting found on some gaming laptops but I’m happy to see some customization offered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IiMzYmVU-_I6PnObn0bkjyCzqUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-3-7cae0e5d13154048bbc93c40976706ca.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> The touchpad is about four inches wide and two and a half inches deep. That’s not bad for a gaming laptop, but average for a productivity machine, and it can feel cramped. It’s responsive and rejects any quick, unintended brush by a palm or thumb. It’s smooth when using multi-touch gestures like two-finger scroll or pinch-to-zoom.</p><h2 id="Audio-Packing-a-punch"><a href="#Audio-Packing-a-punch" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Packing a punch"></a>Audio: Packing a punch</h2><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts. Maximum volume is loud enough to fill an office with music and overcome most ambient noise. There’s even a hint of bass that you’ll feel through your fingertips when the volume is cranked up.</p><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch. It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts.</p><p> There are limits, of course. It isn’t loud enough to project impressive volume in a living room or kitchen. It can also sound muddy and confused when playing bass-forward music or the most frantic action games. Still, it’s an impressive set of speakers that will rarely leave you wanting for more.</p><h2 id="Network-Killer-performance"><a href="#Network-Killer-performance" class="headerlink" title="Network: Killer performance"></a>Network: Killer performance</h2><p> Downloading a big, hot new game can be a real hassle, especially over Wi-Fi, but the Triton 300 SE can help. It has Intel’s Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 and let me tell you: this thing rips.</p><p> It delivered network speeds of over 800 megabits per second (Mbps) near my router, which is typical. Every<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345#:~:text=Wi%2DFi%206%20is%20the,Fi%20faster%20and%20more%20reliable." >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop I review manages that. I was impressed by its performance in my detached office, where the Triton 300 SE hit up to 195Mbps. By comparison, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-5179212" >Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hit only 40Mbps in the same space.</p><p> This translated to excellent real-world results. I created a real-world stress test by downloading Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam while simultaneously downloading Metro Exodus on Epic. Surprisingly, both downloads averaged in excess of 25Mbps. I’m used to seeing numbers in the teens.</p><h2 id="Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam"><a href="#Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)"></a>Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE straddles the line between entertainment and productivity in its design, but the camera falls short of its professional aspirations. It’s a tiny 720p pinhole camera that squeezes between the display and the top bezel. Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972679/19272" target="_top" id="1972679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S.

It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948949/19272" target="_top" id="1948949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136627/26400" target="_top" id="2136627">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136627" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136627/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-review-4795686" >Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006933/19272" target="_top" id="2006933">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006933" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006933/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Predator Triton 300 SE</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>MPN  PT314-51s-71UU</li><li>Price  $1,399.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  3.75 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.7 x 9 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-11375H</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  60 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort mode and ThunderBolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-full-spectrum-analysis-the-logitech-4k-pro-webcam-for-2024/"><u>[New] Full Spectrum Analysis The Logitech 4K Pro Webcam for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-echo-chambers-advanced-mac-audio-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Echo Chambers Advanced Mac Audio Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-spearheading-efficient-speech-recognition-on-google-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Spearheading Efficient Speech Recognition on Google Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/complete-ipad-showdown-which-one-wins/"><u>Complete iPad Showdown: Which One Wins?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/exclusive-free-intro-templates-for-videos/"><u>Exclusive Free Intro Templates for Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-honor-magic-6frp-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Is GSM Flasher ADB Legit?

touchscreen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Awkward setup process</li></ul><p> Fujitsu’s ScanSnap iX1600 is everything you could hope for in a scanner. The all-in-one device offers several new and improved features, explaining why this is now Fujitsu’s flagship scanner. Unlike its well-liked predecessor, the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500, the iX1600 includes a sizable 4.3-inch touchscreen display, faster scanning speeds, and improved software to accelerate your workflow.</p><p> It’s more than just speedy, too. The ScanSnap iX1600 offers up to 30 customizations and can connect from almost anywhere. That includes connecting wirelessly or wired, with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-b-connector-2626033" >USB Type-B connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Wi-Fi (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-5-ghz-wifi-better-than-2-4-ghz-818293" >2.4Ghz&#x2F;5Ghz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) capability, and Bluetooth connectivity. Thanks to so many connection options, creating individual users and separate profiles is possible depending on the scenario.</p><p> However, while the functionality is impressive, the setup could be more comfortable on mobile devices. Our reviewer says, “The mobile apps could use some polish, but the computer app works great for setting up all your profiles.” The iX1600 also scans a receipt destined for Dropbox, converts a document into an email, and transforms an array of physical documents into digital files with varying destinations.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : Yes |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner, copier</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4MbkC2b3SzNKg75xBrsYPIC1wOw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1600_03-83aeb941d40c4cd980e14cbc3cf08b9d.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1600-review-5115487" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1600 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Photos"><a href="#Best-for-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Best for Photos"></a>Best for Photos</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >Epson Perfection V39 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KDKAnJgG-DjrSaVRcEJTmv1ENAI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/epson-perfection-v39-46ba3e522a254eb09a078e416af72191.jpg" >Epson Perfection V39 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB00SSXQ7Q2" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Epson-Perfection-V39-Color-Photo-and-Document-Scanner-Black/45100053?slfpid=3" >$160 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/208634/Epson-Perfection-V39-Color-Scanner/" >$120 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Ability to scan large documents</li><li>Easy to store</li><li>Cloud storage support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Unable to scan film</li><li>No auto document feeder</li></ul><p> If you need a scanner specifically for photos, the Epson Perfection V39 lives up to its name. The flatbed scanner is affordable and precise, producing digital documents with a 4,800<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dpi-in-graphics-1078848" >dpi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> optical resolution.</p><p> Once you’ve scanned your document or photo, you can send it directly to an email address or cloud storage like Evernote or Google Drive. If you want to scan, save, and archive aging family photos or important documents without spending a fortune, the V39 is the ideal option. The scanner also has a removable lid to conveniently scan large and bulky items such as books, making it a portable photocopier ideal for students. It’s storage-friendly, too, thanks to its well-designed build and an integrated kickstand that means you can store it vertically.</p><p> The downside? There’s no auto-document feeder, so scanning many documents can take a while. It’s also unable to scan film and is not the fastest. Still, it’s very convenient despite those flaws.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><h2 id="Best-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Best-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Best Ease of Use"></a>Best Ease of Use</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/shwDwHz8Q0pXgE35e7eq1SIgN0M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-13556924310542afa6aaad1791081047.jpg" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-One-Touch-Document-Scanner/dp/B08PMPHKDV/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB08PMPHKDV" >$350 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-iX1400-Document-scanner-Dual-CIS-Duplex-8-5-x-118-600-dpi-40-ppm-mono-color-ADF-50-sheets-USB-3-2-Gen-1x1/145008599" >$350 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.staples.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-pa03820-b235-duplex-desktop-document-scanner-black/product%5F24478072?cid=AFF:24478072&slfpid=3" >$350 at Staples <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Individual scanning profiles</li><li>Fast scanning speed</li><li>50-sheet automatic document feeder</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No wireless connectivity</li><li>No built-in touchscreen</li></ul><p> The Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 lacks the premium features of the iX1600, but it’s still handy. While there’s frustratingly no wireless connectivity or a built-in touchscreen, its scanning features are nearly indistinguishable from the pricier alternative.</p><p> Whether you’re scanning a business card, receipt, invoice, contract, or beloved photo, the iX1400 does so speedily. Our reviewer Gannon says he “didn’t come across a single time when the scanner felt as though it was trying to play catch up with my computer—even when working with large, high-DPI scans of photographic prints.”</p><p> That’s because the ScanSnap iX1400 scans at an impressive 40-page-per-minute (PPM) speed with a 50-sheet automatic document feeder, ensuring that batch scanning is effortless. The thoughtful design and excellent Fujitsu ScanSnap Home software make smooth scanning possible. The software makes it simple to create individual scanning profiles that you can toggle on as and when needed.</p><p> A single button triggers scanning with customization, meaning you can guarantee your scanned document lands in the correct location.  </p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0IeAW5kutDfn_eYGc0eXeSayCwo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1400_02-4ca641314f2840e3888e50fb6c94b194.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1400"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fujitsu-scansnap-ix1400-review-5115474" >Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Budget"><a href="#Best-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget"></a>Best Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >Canon CanoScan LiDE400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J5mTovLvmWXCmF09qL52fgsreAw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/canon-canoscan-lide400-3be6a43b477343b282e4a6aea8be5718.jpg" >Canon CanoScan LiDE400 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB07G5YBS1W" >$78 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Canon-CanoScan-LiDE-400-2996C002-4800-x-4800dpi-Color-48-bit-Internal-24-bit-External-USB-Type-C-One-Cable-For-Data-Power-Interface-Flatbed-Scanner/296175479?slpfid=3" >$99 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1428261-REG/canon%5F2996c002%5Fcanoscan%5Flide%5F400%5Fcolor.html/?BI=98&kw=CAL400&slfpid=3" >$81 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Auto-scan mode</li><li>Maximum DPI for clear scans</li><li>Compact size</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Setup process for Mac users is challenging</li></ul><p> The Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a highly affordable yet effective scanner. It offers an impressive set of features for the price, including the ability to scan directly to cloud storage.</p><p> Wherever you plan to send your files, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400’s auto-scan mode will detect the size of your documents and adjust accordingly, saving you some effort. It’ll also scan to a maximum of 4800x4800 dpi, guaranteeing precise and accurate digital scans. Buttons on the front of the scanner make scanning even more manageable, with the scanner boasting 8-second speeds.</p><p> Once scanned, it can create PDFs that can be saved directly to your computer’s hard drive. It’s all wonderfully straightforward and convenient, although there are some issues with its Mac setup process. Stick with it, though, and it pays off.</p><p> Beyond the features and price tag, there’s also the usual one-year warranty plus a year’s worth of toll-free technical phone support, which you should not need. If you’re looking for a scanner that gets the job done on a budget, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a great option.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Compact"><a href="#Best-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Best Compact"></a>Best Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >Brother DSmobile DS-940DW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/r7iU27XA5p_GUkL1jUm-3QFxvnU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/brother-dsmobile-ds-940dw-ff2dd0bc3dd64c09801b7a17c2cb8080.jpg" >Brother DSmobile DS-940DW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-DS-940DW-Wireless-Compact-Document/dp/B083R46983/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB083R46983" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Brother-Portable-DS-940DW-Duplex-and-Wireless-Compact-Mobile-Document-Scanner/753713050?slfpid=3" >$200 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/brother-ds-940dw-compact-wireless-duplex-mobile-document-scanner-white/6403626.p?skuId=6403626" >$200 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Compact and portable design</li><li>Great speed for single and double-sided documents</li><li>Wi-Fi and USB connection options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No auto document feeder</li><li>Can’t easily process larger items</li></ul><p> Compact and ideal for any location, the Brother DSmobile DS-940DW is only about the size of a roll of plastic wrap to fit anywhere. It lacks an automatic document feeder because of this and any additional trays, which means it’ll fit into a small home office setup.</p><p> While the DSmobile DS-940DW isn’t aimed at large projects, it still has impressive specifications. It can scan up to 16 pages per minute of single and double-sided documents or business cards without breaking a virtual sweat. Wi-Fi and USB are enabled, too, so it’s easy to hook up to all your devices, whether a desktop, laptop, or mobile.</p><p> Look for aging issues with scanning multiple documents into a single PDF, which should have been resolved with the latest software update.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Wireless"><a href="#Best-Wireless" class="headerlink" title="Best Wireless"></a>Best Wireless</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >Brother ADS-2700W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dNpLawzPVownLkwtcFXMkEqgBtE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/brother-ads-2700w-922ee9ffb2874c8e82706f0bd256703f.jpg" >Brother ADS-2700W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0757Z7NLC?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4072201%7Cn6a872158f0d44de381978a268b92e5d319%7CB0757Z7NLC" >$348 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast scan speed and accuracy</li><li>50-page automatic feeder</li><li>Security features to protect scanned documents</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Touchscreen is only 3 inches</li><li>OCR isn’t functional when scanning to mobile devices</li></ul><p> The convenience of the Brother ADS-2700W is obvious. With extensive wireless capabilities, staying untethered with this scanner is helpful, although it also has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ethernet-3426740" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capability. Scanning is easy and efficient. Scanning to cloud storage, USB, email, a mobile device, and several other places is effortless.</p><p> The scanner’s image optimization features can automatically delete blank pages, enhance colors, and remove unnecessary backgrounds. It’ll scan with the assistance of a 50-page auto feeder. Security features include<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tls-vs-ssl-4156306" >SSL and TLS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a secure file transfer protocol, and a settings lock for those worried about scanning confidential documents.</p><p> The only real downside here is the touchscreen is pretty tiny, at just under 3 inches. That makes navigating difficult for some people, plus OCR isn’t functional when scanning to a mobile device. Despite that, the ADS-2700W is very practical and worth checking out.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : Yes |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-vs-ethernet-which-one-should-you-use-4684496" >Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-Small-Documents"><a href="#Best-for-Small-Documents" class="headerlink" title="Best for Small Documents"></a>Best for Small Documents</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >Ambir DP667 Card Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wDkY6sAZgF9BT0f0IqoxojgomXQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ambir-dp667-card-scanner-b5d3428fe7f74ecca95bc960392b91b9.jpg" >Ambir DP667 Card Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Staples</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ambir-Technology-DocketPort-667-Simplex-Card-Scanner-Black/10363860?slfpid=3" >$160 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.staples.com/ambir-docketport-dp667-portable-card-scanner-black/product%5F1683094" >$212 at Staples <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/689653/DocketPORT-DP667-Card-Scanner-48-bit/?slfpid=3" >$180 at Office Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lightweight and portable</li><li>Designed to quickly scan cards and small documents</li><li>Can convert into PDF file</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Can only scan small items</li><li>Not the fastest at scanning</li></ul><p> If you need a scanner for small documents like business cards or pictures, the Ambir DP667 Card Scanner is perfect. It’s USB-powered and easy to use from pretty much anywhere.</p><p> It can scan business cards or documents measuring up to 4x10 inches, maintaining an impressive 600 dpi resolution. Once scanned, you can easily convert the results into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pdf-file-2622916" >PDF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> documents. The downside here is the DP667 Card Scanner isn’t the fastest scanner on the market. You’ll need patience when scanning business cards, licenses, or receipts, but it’s easy to use.</p><p> Whether you’re keeping up with your networking at a conference or processing ID cards at a hotel desk, the DP667 Card Scanner has you covered. It’s as simple as it is effective.</p><p><strong>Type</strong> : Scanner |<strong>Color&#x2F;Monochrome</strong> : Color |<strong>Connection Type</strong> : USB |<strong>LCD Screen</strong> : No |<strong>Scanner&#x2F;Copier&#x2F;Fax</strong> : Scanner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/clOpEGj1THt62w2x85i8S4728V0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1400_04-727ac7e2ff18426ba2c23a3212ff067e.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1400"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145082/17095" target="_top" id="2145082">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145082" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145082/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-When-Buying-Photo-and-Document-Scanners"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-When-Buying-Photo-and-Document-Scanners" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For When Buying Photo and Document Scanners"></a>What to Look For When Buying Photo and Document Scanners</h2><h3 id="Media-Type"><a href="#Media-Type" class="headerlink" title="Media Type"></a>Media Type</h3><p> How are you planning to use it? A portable scanner might be your best option if you only scan business cards. Alternatively, if you’re looking to scan family heirlooms, you want a model that captures high-quality photos rather than focuses on OCR conversion. For an office environment, being able to scan text well is critical. Depending on your budget, higher-end units are great at everything you throw at them. They can include adjustable sliders, separate bays, and features that simplify the results.</p><h3 id="Scan-Speed"><a href="#Scan-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Scan Speed"></a>Scan Speed</h3><p> If you’re often short on time, impatient, or have many items to scan, you want a scanner that can keep up with you. Look at how many pages a scanner can handle per minute. Also, consider scanners with automatic document feeders if you scan many documents simultaneously. It’ll save you time and effort. However, if you only do it occasionally, you may be better off spending less or focusing on something with more features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/k1E2cV-iUFP2DRxqA5Cv59wqUW0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fujitsu_ScanSnap_ix1600_04-35e5256d360d467a9825ad999e23f8b8.jpg"                      alt="Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cloud-Support"><a href="#Cloud-Support" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Support"></a>Cloud Support</h3><p> Do you want to be able to access your scanned documents from anywhere? That’s an option if you pick a scanner with cloud support. Many document and photo scanners offer such functionality to scan and upload files directly to the cloud. Look for one that supports Google Drive, Dropbox, or your preferred cloud service for maximum efficiency.</p><h3 id="Portability"><a href="#Portability" class="headerlink" title="Portability"></a>Portability</h3><p> You won’t have to worry about storage if you have a large home office or small business setup. However, if you’re tight on space or want to take a document scanner with you wherever you go, look for one that’s small and lightweight. A bulky solution will only slow you down and is best suited for a permanent home in your office.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What should you prioritize when buying a document scanner?<br> Every scanner is flawed, so weighing what you need most is crucial. If you need to scan documents occasionally rather than daily, the scanning speed may be less critical. In all cases, though, it’s good to look for an accurate scanner so that the results look perfect every time. An automatic document feeder is often helpful, but it’s optional if you need to scan only a few documents at a time. A better option would be to pick a scanner with suitable software to help you out.</li><li>Are different connectivity types essential?<br> Depending on how you plan to use your document scanner, having different connectivity options at your disposal can be helpful. Many scanners offer Wi-Fi support, which is useful if you plan on scanning to a mobile device or don’t want to be tied down by cables. However, Wi-Fi support is optional if you have a correctly wired home office setup.</li><li>Which is the most common type of scanner?<br> A flatbed scanner is the most common type; inserting documents is generally much more accessible. Some require you to feed the paper manually, making it tricky to do so without damaging the physical item. Look for the most convenient method for your plans. A removable lid can be helpful if you plan on scanning large documents such as books.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flickvista-app-performance-index/"><u>2024 Approved FlickVista App Performance Index</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/approved-stepwise-strategies-to-perfect-youtube-trailers-by-filmora/"><u>2024 Approved Stepwise Strategies to Perfect YouTube Trailers by Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/achieve-unparalleled-cpu-speeds-using-our-advanced-ai-generated-liquid-nitrogen-vessel-up-to-3x-faster-than-regular-techniques/"><u>Achieve Unparalleled CPU Speeds Using Our Advanced, AI-Generated Liquid Nitrogen Vessel – Up to 3X Faster than Regular Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/apples-latest-innovation-comparing-the-power-of-m1-vs-m0-chips/"><u>Apple's Latest Innovation: Comparing the Power of M1 vs M0 Chips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/evaluating-webex-pros-vs-cons-of-this-popular-online-meeting-solution/"><u>Evaluating WebEx: Pros Vs.

However, most of gaming’s history remains stranded on past hardware.</p><p> There are entire franchises considered to be classics that have been unavailable for generations. Take <em>God of War</em>, for example. Given the immense popularity of its dad-ified rebirth with the eponymous 2018 reboot, it’s easy to forget that the original series (save a remaster of the third game) hasn’t been available on any platform since PlayStation 3. As PlayStation 4 and 5 don’t have cross-compatibility with their forefathers, the only way to play the iconic Greek trilogy is by plugging in an old console.</p><p> While I cherry-picked <em>God of War</em> as a particularly noteworthy example given its recent entries have skyrocketed the series’ popularity to new heights, the same issue permeates franchises of all shapes and sizes. First-party efforts are most subject to this abandonment as there’s typically no native PC alternative to fall back to. Even franchises that you might not expect fall prey to this, like <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> releases on the DS and 3DS.</p><p> Xbox fares a bit better given Microsoft’s initiatives to make old libraries backward compatible, though there are still many games that didn’t make the cut, including most of the original Xbox’s library. This is to say that even in the best-case scenario, only a selection of older games are made available to modern gamers.</p><p> Cartridge-based generations are filled with titles that have never seen the light of day since their initial release, and many of these can be expensive if they’re not already in your collection. This is where <a class="link"   href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-first-time-furnishings-minimalist-house-plans-in-mc/" >products like EverDrive cartridges become essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, providing a base upon which you can play <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-video-revenue-generation-on-facebook-tactics-for-financial-growth-for-2024/" >legally dumped ROMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on original hardware.</p><p> Products like this offer an authentic experience at a fraction of the cost of some of the rarest titles. They also reduce the effort of switching cartridges and the physical toll it can take on the games when doing so. EverDrive cartridges for handhelds are becoming a necessity for preserving libraries as old cartridge batteries are quickly dying out.</p><p> Handhelds are perhaps the gaming devices that are most essential to hold on to. Their form factor means that games render at low resolutions and in some cases utilize features like touch screens that aren’t easy to emulate well. Thus, most games will play best on the handheld they’re designed for. Just make sure to properly care for them by removing batteries when not playing to prevent damage.</p><h2 id="Remaster-and-Remake-Doesn’t-Always-Mean-Better"><a href="#Remaster-and-Remake-Doesn’t-Always-Mean-Better" class="headerlink" title="Remaster and Remake Doesn’t Always Mean Better"></a>Remaster and Remake Doesn’t Always Mean Better</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nn4iuorglwf1p6nsbbqinu8j-png.jpeg"                      alt="Shadow of the Colossus Remake on PS4."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144277/7443" target="_top" id="2144277">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144277" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144277/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Sony</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ten-simple-steps-to-acquire-igtv-media/" >Ports, remasters, and remakes make old games more accessible <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but usually come with a series of caveats. These can include increased input latency, incorrect aspect ratios, art style alterations, and mechanical or balancing changes that alter the game’s feel (among others). I recommend keeping your options open so that you can return to the original releases.</p><p> A prime example of a one-for-one remake that was beautiful in its own right but by no means supplanted its original release is <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> on PlayStation 4. It’s an undeniably gorgeous game—especially in how it renders the titular colossi—though some of the melancholic artistic touch of the original was lost in the redrawn, higher fidelity visuals. Additionally, it streamlined the controls for modern sensibilities, rubbing some fans of the original the wrong way. It’s still a wonderful game, but it simply doesn’t replace the original. If you have a PlayStation 2 on hand, you get to make the choice of which best suits your tastes.</p><p> We can similarly apply this to <em>Pokémon</em> and its ongoing series of remakes. Putting aside perceptions of quality (good or bad), these new versions of early generations provide very different experiences, particularly with the advent of 3D graphics. These are essentially entirely different games, yet their existence has made Nintendo reluctant to make the originals available by any means other than decades-old handheld technology.</p><p> In fact, the first generation of <em>Pokémon</em> has been remade twice, which leaves the middle siblings of <em>Fire Red</em> and _Leaf Green_—often considered the best rendition of the generation—to languish on Game Boy Advance two decades after their initial release.</p><p> Ports can also be tricky to get right. The many HD <em>Final Fantasy</em> ports released by Square Enix are fine but often lack effects that were only possible on original PlayStation hardware or, in the case of the <em>Pixel Remaster</em> series, redrew the sprites. There’s also a clash of higher resolution 3D assets that clash with low-resolution backgrounds, <a class="link"   href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/collaborative-sing-along-tiktok-feature/" >something CRTs covered over with scan lines in these games’ heyday <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you happen to have a CRT, holding onto old consoles will allow you to play games from eras designed around such displays.</p><p> There are endless examples I could provide (high input latency in fighting game ports has been a consistent issue, for example) but I don’t want to come across as slagging efforts to bring aging games to modern audiences. But if you’re a stickler for authenticity, there are a plethora of cases in which keeping old consoles (and old TVs, if you really have the space) remains the best way to achieve your desires.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885928/19272" target="_top" id="1885928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modding-Breathes-New-Life-into-Consoles"><a href="#Modding-Breathes-New-Life-into-Consoles" class="headerlink" title="Modding Breathes New Life into Consoles"></a>Modding Breathes New Life into Consoles</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/h2x1_wiiu_welcome_v07_image1600w.jpg"                      alt="Wii U marketing image from Nintendo website."                > </p><p>Nintendo</p><p> I should preface this section by noting that I’m not much of a modder myself. However, it’s a key capacity in which people keep their erstwhile consoles relevant. It provides ways to alter existing games with fan-made content, sideload games, play on fan-hosted servers, and turn these boxes into emulation powerhouses.</p><p> You’ll want to do your own research on exactly what these modding processes entail, but the good news is that for some consoles you don’t even need to mod anything in order to enjoy some of this functionality. For example, <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-foundations-of-effective-youtube-broadcasting/" >booting your Xbox into Developer Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (which requires a one-time activation fee of $20) allows you to <a class="link"   href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-leveraging-filters-masks-and-effects-to-elevate-conference-calls/" >run emulators like RetroArch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, though you’ll need to return to retail mode in order to play your native game library. Further, <a class="link"   href="https://pretendo.network/" >Pretendo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers both 3DS and Wii U fan-run servers for the most popular games on older Nintendo platforms, and the Wii U version only requires some ISP manipulation to get running.</p><p> Of course, things can go wrong when modding a console, even with the most trusted software. It’s typically a low risk, but one you should understand before beginning the process. My recommendation would be not to begin this process on any console you’d be sad to potentially lose.</p><h2 id="Which-Consoles-Are-Essential-to-Keep"><a href="#Which-Consoles-Are-Essential-to-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Which Consoles Are Essential to Keep?"></a>Which Consoles Are Essential to Keep?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8705d94c.jpg"                      alt="PlayStation 3 DualShock 3 controller."                > </p><p>Craig Lloyd &#x2F; Review Geek</p><p> There are many factors that determine which consoles are most worth keeping for any individual. Here are some specific consoles that are particularly valuable to have on-hand.</p><p> First up, if you have an early PlayStation 3 model (yes, the one that was infamously $600), it’s also capable of natively running PlayStation 1 <em>and</em> PlayStation 2 discs. This functionality was removed from later models to reduce cost. While the modem may require extra upkeep compared to later models, you’ll be saving a lot of space by essentially having three consoles in one. It’s not worth getting this at a high second-hand markup, but if you own it, you’ve got gold on your hands.</p><p> Early 3D consoles like the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation are also keepers as many of the graphical flourishes they achieved in-game (such as fog in Nintendo 64 games) are notoriously imperfectly replicated by emulation. Consoles of this era and prior are simply fun to use. Slotting in cartridges and playing on controllers that pre-date design homogenization makes gaming feel truly retro. To this same end, the Wii is probably worth keeping for its singular take on motion controls.</p><p> On the handheld front, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-mastering-low-light-photos-on-ios-11/" >the Nintendo DS and 3DS lines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>—as well as the Vita, which is particularly beloved by the modding community—are worth retaining in your collection as they provide unique gaming experiences that we may never see again. Dual screens, autostereoscopic 3D, cameras, rear touchpads, and so on are interesting products of their time which will only make them more so as stand-alone handhelds are all but a thing of the past. As previously mentioned, these features also make emulation of games that utilize them difficult. In other words, these handhelds will never be obsolete.</p><p> An <a class="link"   href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket" >Analogue Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is worth considering as a catch-all for older handhelds if you want to consolidate your hardware collection. It uses an <a class="link"   href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cutting-edge-captures-top-10-online-video-recorders/" >FPGA chip to virtualize original hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> boasts a beautiful screen, cartridge adapters for different handhelds, and a suite of features to customize your experience. It’s definitely not a cheap investment but one to consider as a worthy alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/analogue_pocket.jpg"                      alt="Analogue Pocket portable FPGA."                > </p><p>Analogue</p><hr><p> As long as you have the space to store them and a willingness to maintain them, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/capture-the-world-with-these-leading-4k-cams-for-2024/" >holding on to your old consoles is a great way to keep your gaming options open <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and return to titles that may never see a modern release. It’s also great for those moments when you want to take a trip down memory lane. It may seem like a burden to keep your closet filled with gaming devices for the moment, but it’ll pay off with time.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-motorcycle-mastery-the-top-ranked-action-cameras-for-23-riders/"><u>[New] Motorcycle Mastery – The Top-Ranked Action Cameras for '23 Riders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-master-the-art-of-customization-for-youtube-shorts-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Master the Art of Customization for YouTube Shorts Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-earnings-in-the-virtual-playground/"><u>2024 Approved Earnings in the Virtual Playground</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/connectivity-revolutionized-a-thorough-review-of-linksyss-advanced-ea9500-wireless-router/"><u>Connectivity Revolutionized: A Thorough Review of Linksys's Advanced EA9500 Wireless Router</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/te-your-content-strategy-prime-video-rank-monitors-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Content Strategy Prime Video Rank Monitors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/how-to-capture-and-save-line-video-chats-with-audio-complete-tutorial/"><u>HOW TO: Capture and Save LINE Video Chats with Audio – Complete Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-samsung-galaxy-a14-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Fake Snapchat Location without Jailbreak On Samsung Galaxy A14 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-comprehensive-guide-to-attractive-and-engaging-instagram-puzzle-feeds/"><u>In 2024, The Comprehensive Guide to Attractive and Engaging Instagram Puzzle Feeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/maximize-apple-watch-endurance-with-our-expert-tips-on-key-configuration-tweaks/"><u>Maximize Apple Watch Endurance with Our Expert Tips on Key Configuration Tweaks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-countdown-how-real-life-console-clashes-outshine-online-lan-bouts/"><u>The Ultimate Countdown: How Real-Life Console Clashes Outshine Online LAN Bouts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/timeless-entertainment-how-the-panic-playdate-continues-to-delight-gamers-beyond-its-second-anniversary/"><u>Timeless Entertainment: How the Panic Playdate Continues to Delight Gamers Beyond Its Second Anniversary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-8-essential-steam-deck-gadgets-and-peripherals-you-must-have/"><u>Top 8 Essential Steam Deck Gadgets and Peripherals You Must Have</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/turn-off-screen-lock-xiaomi-redmi-k70-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Turn Off Screen Lock -

Unfortunately, there are two big obstacles to reading your Amazon books on other devices: the AZW file format and the DRM. Fortunately for you, we have a guide to navigating these.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398449/3022" target="_top" id="398449">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398449" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398449/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-the-AZW-File-Format"><a href="#What-Is-the-AZW-File-Format" class="headerlink" title="What Is the AZW File Format?"></a>What Is the AZW File Format?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-16_11h31_50.png"                      alt="Kindle ebook files in the AZW format"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144283/7443" target="_top" id="2144283">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144283" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144283/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> When you download a Kindle ebook, it will be in the <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-elevate-your-videos-visibility-with-perfect-thumbnail-sizing-for-2024/" >AZW format <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

When you buy a book from the Kindle store, chances are it will be in the AZW format.</p><p> Unfortunately, this format is only compatible with Amazon devices and, therefore, won’t work with other eReaders such as Kobo and Nook. When you want to move a Kindle book to another device, you will have to convert it into a format that eReader can use. Kobo supports <a class="link"   href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017763713-File-formats-your-Kobo-eReader-and-Kobo-Books-app-support" >a whole list of file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-instagram-video-to-mp3-everything-you-need-to-know/" >EPUB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the digital publishing standard for ebooks.

It’s basically a safeguard against piracy, and it prevents you from reading your Kindle ebooks on other devices, so when it comes to reading on your Kobo, you will need to strip the DRM from the files before you can read them. It is legal to strip the DRM from ebooks you have bought, but not for distribution purposes. Bear in mind this excludes books you have only borrowed, such as library books.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100533/7443" target="_top" id="2100533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-I-Get-Started"><a href="#How-Do-I-Get-Started" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Get Started?"></a>How Do I Get Started?</h2><p> First of all, take a deep breath. This can be a pretty involved process, but once you have everything set up, it will make organizing your ebook library much easier in the long run.</p><p> Step one is getting <a class="link"   href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" >Calibre <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> set up on your computer. Calibre is a free and open-source ebook management tool. It is well worth downloading if you own an eReader, because <a class="link"   href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-webcam-setup-for-quick-recordings-on-chromebooks/" >it does pretty much everything <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you may need as an ebook reader, and if you do somehow manage to find something Calibre doesn’t do, you can usually find a plug-in to help. Adding, removing and editing ebooks on your eReader is easy using Calibre, and even if you don’t want to use any of its features, having a backup copy of your ebook library is always good practice just in case.</p><p> To download Calibre, head to their <a class="link"   href="https://calibre-ebook.com/download" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download the version you want. Follow the set-up wizard.</p><p> Unfortunately, DRM stripping isn’t something Calibre offers, so once you have it set up, you will need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/" >DeDRM plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is a plugin that will sit in Calibre and automatically strip the DRM from any books you add to Calibre. It won’t strip the DRM from any existing books, however, so you will have to export and import them again.</p><p> To download the DeDRM plugin, head to their <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM%5Ftools/releases" >GitHub repository <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download the latest release. Once the plugin has been downloaded, unzip the contents.</p><h2 id="Stripping-the-DRM"><a href="#Stripping-the-DRM" class="headerlink" title="Stripping the DRM"></a>Stripping the DRM</h2><p> Now that you have downloaded both Calibre and the DeDRM plugin, open Calibre and select Preferences &gt; Plugins &gt; Load Plugin From File. Find your unzipped plugin, select it, and navigate to the “DeDRM_plugin.zip” file within the “DeDRM_tools_7.2.1” folder. Calibre may prompt you to accept a virus warning and restart the application.</p><p>Close </p><p> Once the plugin has been installed, it will need to be calibrated to strip the DRM from Kindle ebooks. In Calibre, go to Preferences &gt; Plugins and open the “File Type”drop-down menu. Double-click on the DeDRM listing. Choose “eInk Kindle ebooks” from the list and add your device’s serial number, which you can find in the device’s settings menu.</p><p>Close </p><p> Now that the plugin is successfully integrated into Calibre, it will automatically strip the DRM from any new ebooks. You will have to remove and add any existing ebooks if they need their DRM stripped.</p><h2 id="Converting-From-AZW-to-EPUB"><a href="#Converting-From-AZW-to-EPUB" class="headerlink" title="Converting From AZW to EPUB"></a>Converting From AZW to EPUB</h2><p> Once your Kindle ebooks have had the DRM stripped from them, the only thing left to do is convert them to a file format that can be read by other types of eReader. Calibre will actually do this automatically when sending books to a new device if they are not in a compatible format. Alternatively, you can do it manually by selecting a book, clicking the “Convert books” button, and then changing the output type.</p><p> Congratulations! You now have a manageable ebook library in Calibre and can move your DRM-free books between any devices you own.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/10-passport-photo-generator-download-print-for-free/"><u>10 Passport Photo Generator Download, Print for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/2024-j-pop-mp3/"><u>2024年の新案: J-POP MP3曲を免費中継ダウンロード手順ガイド</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-outstanding.techidaily.com/best-free-online-streaming-platforms-top-picks-for-watching-movies-on-windows-11-and-mobile-devices/"><u>Best Free Online Streaming Platforms: Top Picks for Watching Movies on Windows 11 and Mobile Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/beyond-entertainment-utilizing-your-tv-remote-for-game-console-management-and-more/"><u>Beyond Entertainment: Utilizing Your TV Remote for Game Console Management & More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/blancco-a-commercial-data-wiping-solution-offering-multiple-features-for-securely-deleting-sensitive-information-from-various-types-of-storage-devices-inclu23/"><u>Blancco: A Commercial Data Wiping Solution Offering Multiple Features for Securely Deleting Sensitive Information From Various Types of Storage Devices, Including Mobile and IoT Gadgets.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-fresh-tunes-with-apple-music-radio-your-gateway-to-the-latest-hits/"><u>Discover Fresh Tunes with Apple Music Radio: Your Gateway to the Latest Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discover-how-ray-tracing-transcends-tricks-to-offer-gaming-and-visualizing-a-quantum-leap-in-realism/"><u>Discover How Ray Tracing Transcends Tricks to Offer Gaming and Visualizing a Quantum Leap in Realism</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/essential-techniques-for-optimizing-your-prints-from-photoshop/"><u>Essential Techniques for Optimizing Your Prints From Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-life360-notify-when-you-log-out-on-asus-rog-phone-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Asus ROG Phone 8? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-image-editing-mastering-photo-cropping-tools/"><u>In 2024, IPhone Image Editing Mastering Photo Cropping Tools</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s a larger, wider notebook given the 15.6-inch display, but at just 2.4 pounds it is shockingly light. It’s a flyweight in a category ruled by featherweights, and while it doesn’t have quite the dense, durable-feeling form of some competitors, the lightness sure sets it apart.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike. But does LG’s laptop (2018 model reviewed) really stack up to the likes of the Apple MacBook Air and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 in terms of value and overall experience? Read on to see what we thought.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/radDS_2IRuzjTlZxUS5og2a3PIM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Top_04-b051e3660efc406ab97f92df654d3762.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing"><a href="#Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing" class="headerlink" title="Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing"></a><strong>Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing</strong></h2><p> Weight aside, the LG Gram 15.6-inch doesn’t make the strongest impression in the category. It’s a relatively minimal design that’s not too fussed-over, but doesn’t give the impression that it was chiseled out of a solid brick of aluminum like a MacBook Air or Pro. In fact, it’s made from nano carbon magnesium, which must be how LG kept it so darn light.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >MacBook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Surface Laptop. It’s incredibly thin metal all around the exterior, to the extent to which a firm press on any surface just gives a little too much to feel comfortable. Likewise, the screen hinge isn’t nearly as secure as other laptops we’ve tested in this category. Our tested version didn’t come with the optional touch display, but we imagine it would be tricky to use with this much give to the display hinge.</p><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant.</p><p> In any case, that’s the trade-off for the incredible lightness, which really is amazing. The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant. This is an easy laptop to cart around or pop into a messenger bag—although it is quite wide at 14.1 inches. That’s the nature of the beast with a larger screen, but just make sure that you have a bag that can handle it.</p><p> When it comes to ports, the LG Gram 15.6-inch leaves little behind. It’s decked out. On the left side, you’ll find a USB 3.0 port, USB-C port, and an HDMI port, along with the port for the included power cable—although you can also charge via USB-C. Look over on the right side and you’ll find two more USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack, and even a microSD slot. Compared to those aforementioned Apple and Microsoft laptops that stick with one or two USB or USB-C ports, the LG Gram comes across as incredibly generous.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in ‘—‘ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days.</p><p> Getting our hands on the keyboard, some frustrations quickly emerged. Given the wide 15.6-inch display, LG had a lot of space to work with for the keyboard, and so it added in a full keypad to the right of the QWERTY keyboard. The problem here is twofold: some of the most-used keys, like backspace, are smaller than on many other keyboards. And to complicate matters, the keypad is scrunched right up against the keyboard without a break.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in “—“ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days. Eventually, we started learning from the harsh experience of having to essentially double-delete characters, so it’s likely that you’ll get used to the keyboard’s quirks. Typing on the keys feels great, at least: they’re soft and quiet, and enabled speedy input when not fighting those odd layout issues. On balance, it’s very usable and responsive, but still tries to cram too many keys into the available space. The trackpad, meanwhile, works fine but definitely feels a bit small on that wide body—Apple’s extra-large trackpads are spoiling us.</p><p> The entry-level model we reviewed comes with a meaty 256GB solid state drive (SSD), which is double the SSD storage we typically see in a base model laptop. While 128GB might be cutting it close for some users, the boosted tally provides plenty more space for game downloads and storing local media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1qu1WvdEgTzjUQ8QH_Lssx79xF0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Trackpad_05-f0d9dc63b03e4650a92e30747090889a.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions"><a href="#Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Just follow the directions"></a><strong>Setup Process: Just follow the directions</strong></h2><p> There’s little reason to worry about getting the LG Gram 15.6-inch laptop up and running quickly. It has Windows 10 pre-installed, so you’ll simply follow the onscreen prompts to enter your Wi-Fi info, check for updates, select a few options, and ultimately find yourself ready to roll on the desktop. It shouldn’t take more than a handful of minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151854/7443" target="_top" id="2151854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151854/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Large-and-capable-enough"><a href="#Display-Large-and-capable-enough" class="headerlink" title="Display: Large and capable enough"></a><strong>Display: Large and capable enough</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram’s 15.6-inch screen is good, but not great. It’s certainly large: the widescreen panel stretches out longer than the 13-inch screens seen on a lot of ultraportable computers, and the extra real estate is absolutely noticeable. It gives you enough extra space to comfortably multitask, such as having a web browser and a document side-by-side, or a Slack window in full view to distract you from whatever you’re supposed to be doing for work.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike.</p><p> The downside is that this 1920x1080 IPS LCS panel isn’t nearly as high-resolution as some of its rivals, such as the MacBook Air (2560x1600) and Surface Laptop 2 (2256x1504)—both of which also benefit from squeezing their pixels into smaller respective frames. The LG Gram just doesn’t have the pin-sharp allure of those screens, plus it looks dimmer and doesn’t come across as vibrant as a result. It’s solid, and 1080p can certainly get the job done, but there are much better-looking screens in this category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TFbt9G36hk5JyrBL8cIdIuYQ66E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Keyboard_03-fd7e355ac5944f12a8107746d0afbf24.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047361/19272" target="_top" id="2047361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks"><a href="#Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks"></a><strong>Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks</strong></h2><p> With an 8th-gen Intel Core i5-8250U at 1.6Ghz and 8GB RAM onboard, the 2018 LG Gram runs on the same chipset as the Surface Laptop 2 and Dell XPS 13. It provides solid power for everyday tasks, and we didn’t run into any noticeable slowdown while moving around Windows 10, surfing the web, typing up documents, and loading up apps. It’s not a powerhouse CPU, however, and creative professionals looking for a machine for photo or video editing, for example, will surely want more processing power and RAM to play with.</p><p> In benchmark testing, the Cinebench score of 1,173 was higher than the 1,017 we registered on the entry-level Surface Laptop 2 (and higher is better), and the 975 seen on the 4K screen-equipped Dell XPS. The PCMark 10 score was higher, as well, with 3,085 on the LG Gram and just 2,112 on the Surface Laptop 2.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a MacBook or Surface Laptop.</p><p> With an integrated Intel Graphics UHD 620 GPU inside, the LG Gram isn’t built for intense gaming needs. However, it does OK with modern 3D games at low-to-medium settings. As has been the case with other laptops we’ve tried, battle royale shooter smash Fortnite defaulted to settings that looked nice but led to a very choppy frame rate in action, and we ultimately had to turn off all effects and hit low settings on nearly everything to make the game run smoothly. Switching to Rocket League, the car-soccer game ran decently with mid-to-high settings, but again we trimmed down a few settings for a speedier frame rate.</p><p> As an aside, while the LG Gram often runs near-silently, there are extended periods of time in which there’s an audible hum coming from the back. It’s not the typical, very loud fan noise that pops up while gaming or heavy multitasking from some computers, but it can be a bit grating. We noticed it while charging the computer, but also while running on the battery—with no consistency on that front. It’s a mild annoyance, but it’s one we noticed whenever it emerged.</p><h2 id="Audio-It-makes-an-impression"><a href="#Audio-It-makes-an-impression" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It makes an impression"></a><strong>Audio: It makes an impression</strong></h2><p> You won’t see the speakers when the LG Gram is standing up as normal, but you’ll hear them loud and clear. The stereo speakers are tucked underneath the laptop at the left and right edges near where your wrists rest, and thanks to the slight elevation from the rubbery feet on the bottom of the laptop, they’re given enough space for the output to shine. Audio playback sounds robust and clear—not quite to the level of Apple’s current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, but very close. We were pleased with it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938750/19272" target="_top" id="1938750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938750/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Connects-as-expected"><a href="#Network-Connects-as-expected" class="headerlink" title="Network: Connects as expected"></a><strong>Network: Connects as expected</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram had no problem connecting to a few different networks, including a home Wi-Fi network, the Google Wi-Fi network at Starbucks, and a mobile hotspot. The connection always seemed speedy and downloads ran at a steady clip. Testing it on a home Wi-Fi network during peak evening hours, we saw a download speed of about 30Mbps and an upload speed of 13Mbps. We tested the network on an iPhone XS Max immediately after and saw comparable speeds there, as well. You can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks with ease.</p><p> Interestingly, the LG Gram also has an Ethernet-to-USB-C dongle included in the box. That’ll be handy if the Wi-Fi is on the fritz, or you’re at a hotel or conference center that somehow doesn’t have Wi-Fi in the year 2019.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AhDZOG33ttJ8LfKQnzvHO7K-S8I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Closed_02-d40445064b4945729278aeae3d8ae1c0.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Battery-Seriously-amazing"><a href="#Battery-Seriously-amazing" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Seriously amazing"></a><strong>Battery: Seriously amazing</strong></h2><p> The battery is undoubtedly one of the key highlights of the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) experience. This massive 72Wh cell is estimated to provide upwards of 19 hours of uptime, according to LG—but as is usually the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , that estimate isn’t reflective of typical use cases. Even so, with max brightness, the fact that we could get about half that amount still makes for a long-lasting experience.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100 percent brightness. That means it’s built for a full-on workday, which makes it a great option for productivity. In our video rundown test, in which we constantly stream a Netflix movie at 100 percent brightness, the LG Gram 15.6-inch lasted for 9 hours, 14 minutes. With locally-stored video, you’re sure to get a whole lot more out of it.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100% brightness.</p><h2 id="Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello"><a href="#Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello" class="headerlink" title="Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)"></a><strong>Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch comes with Windows 10 Home preinstalled, and if you’ve used Windows over the years, then you should be pretty comfortable here. Windows 10 has lightly evolved the PC operating system with feature enhancements and tweaks without losing the classic, familiar DNA within, and it’s the OS of choice for computer gaming and apps of all shapes and sizes. It’s easy to use and understand, and runs well with the Intel Core i5 and an SSD onboard.</p><p> Unfortunately, this entry-level model of the LG Gram 15.6-inch isn’t able to take advantage of Windows Hello biometric security, as the camera above the display doesn’t have the needed sensors for scanning your face. We missed the near-instantaneous facial recognition of the Surface Laptop 2, and having to type in a PIN number each time we opened up the lid. Pricier models of the laptop offer a fingerprint scanner, however.</p><h2 id="Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths"><a href="#Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths" class="headerlink" title="Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths"></a><strong>Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths</strong></h2><p> Originally priced at $1,249, the entry-level LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) can now be found for about $999 as of this writing. LG has rolled out newer 2019 versions that look identical and have the same core features, but upgrade to the latest generation of Intel Core processors. You should see a little bit more speed in benchmark testing, although it’s unclear whether there’s any noticeable difference during regular usage.</p><p> In any case, $999 is a more appealing value for a computer that doesn’t pack as much polish as some rivals, but wins out when it comes to elements like battery life, screen size, and minimal weight. For some users, that’s sure to be an appealing combination. Note that you can spend quite a bit on upgrades with the LG Gram 15.6-inch, including opting for versions with a faster Intel Core i7 processor, additional RAM, a fingerprint sensor, and even a touch display if desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5yzhAkphyYfWOMofqawuktHJlA0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-v.-Surface-comparison-4946178bf2e94230820d2b19d2fb7197.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137213/26400" target="_top" id="2137213">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137213" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137213/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own"><a href="#LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own" class="headerlink" title="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?"></a><strong>LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 are similarly equipped, in terms of having the same processor and integrated graphics chip, although they vary quite a bit from there.

However, if you’re in the market for an incredibly light laptop with a big screen and a battery that lasts and lasts, it’s hard to ignore the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018). You get a very capable computer for the price, and it’s a notebook that can legitimately last through a full workday even at max brightness.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Gram 15.6-inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>UPC  15Z980-U.AAS5U1 &#x2F; 719192618947</li><li>Price  $947.77</li><li>Release Date  December 2017</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.4 x 10.7 x 2.4 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  1.6Ghz quad-core Intel Core i5 8250U</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  256GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  72 Wh</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 3x USB-3, HDMI, microSD, 3.5mm headphone port</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-shaping-narratives-through-text-effects/"><u>2024 Approved Shaping Narratives Through Text Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/audews-handy-air-compressor-unveiling-the-power-of-a-miniature-marvel/"><u>Audew's Handy Air Compressor: Unveiling the Power of a Miniature Marvel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-revolutionize-social-sagas-no-cost-for-online-and-mobile-excellence/"><u>In 2024, Revolutionize Social Sagas – No Cost for Online & Mobile Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-guide-unravel-the-secrets-of-stellaris-galactic-colonization-and-warfare/"><u>In-Depth Guide: Unravel the Secrets of Stellaris - Galactic Colonization & Warfare</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/innovative-strategies-for-combining-obs-with-zoom-platform/"><u>Innovative Strategies for Combining OBS with Zoom Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/lg-k51-smartphone-analysis-stunning-design-marred-by-sluggish-cpu/"><u>LG K51 Smartphone Analysis: Stunning Design Marred by Sluggish CPU</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/logitech-g533-review/"><u>Logitech G533 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/mastering-iphone-auto-correct-six-effective-solutions-to-improve-typing-accuracy/"><u>Mastering iPhone Auto-Correct: Six Effective Solutions to Improve Typing Accuracy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/must-consider-points-to-keep-in-mind-when-shopping-for-vr-equipment/"><u>Must Consider Points to Keep in Mind when Shopping for VR Equipment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/new-marshall-anc-review-chic-design-superior-audio/"><u>New Marshall ANC Review: Chic Design, Superior Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/on-the-go-literacy-lovers-guide-comprehensive-kobo-clara-hd-reader-evaluation/"><u>On-the-Go Literacy Lover's Guide: Comprehensive Kobo Clara HD Reader Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/1722868174752-resolving-noise-issues-in-your-stereo-system-restore-the-sound/"><u>Resolving Noise Issues in Your Stereo System - Restore the Sound</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-creating-a-windows-11-uefi-bootable-installation-media/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a Windows 11 UEFI Bootable Installation Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-budget-conscious-consumers-guide-to-the-superior-lg-24lh4830-smart-tv/"><u>The Budget-Conscious Consumer's Guide to the Superior LG 24LH4830 Smart TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/windows-11-quick-guide-to-open-sticky-notes/"><u>Windows 11: Quick Guide to Open Sticky Notes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/youtube-music-composition-techniques-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Music Composition Techniques for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveiling-the-Perks-How-Digital-Comics-on-Tablets-Triumph-over-Paper-Editions"><a href="#Unveiling-the-Perks-How-Digital-Comics-on-Tablets-Triumph-over-Paper-Editions" class="headerlink" title="Unveiling the Perks: How Digital Comics on Tablets Triumph over Paper Editions"></a>Unveiling the Perks: How Digital Comics on Tablets Triumph over Paper Editions</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Tablets make reading comics affordable and convenient through digital subscriptions like Marvel Unlimited.</li><li>The quality of digital comics is superior due to high-resolution assets, crucial for those with bad eyesight.</li><li>Guided views on tablets simplify busy comic pages, helping new readers understand complex storylines more easily.</li></ul><p> I’ve dabbled with print-based comic books off and on in my life, but not until I embraced tablets have I really engaged with the medium. Now I read comics daily, and there are several reasons why I prefer the screen to the paper page when it comes to my superhero fix.</p><h2 id="It’s-Affordable"><a href="#It’s-Affordable" class="headerlink" title="It’s Affordable"></a>It’s Affordable</h2><p> Comic books used to be cheap, like <em>really</em> cheap. The weekly stuff was printed on cheap paper, and they weren’t expected to last long. Fast-forward to today and just paying for issues of one series will cost you $5 to $10 a month, depending on whether it’s a monthly or bi-weekly series. So you’re looking at $60+ a year for one series. Add to that all the crossover series, and you’ll almost certainly need to buy books from other series to get the whole story, so you’re looking at hundreds of dollars per year.</p><p> Now, I can already hear Comic Book Guy raising his hand in the back pointing out that the average comic book price increase hasn’t been much different than average inflation levels, which means that individual issues aren’t really more expensive in real terms. However, while that may be true, the industry today is much different and how many issues you have to buy in the hobby to get the most out of it looks a little different. Comic book publishers have learned all the tricks, which is fine because their job is to sell books. However, for the average person, especially in tough economic conditions, things can add up fast.</p><p> So, reading comic books on my tablet is more affordable. However, digital comics cost the same as paper editions! Yes, like <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-evolution-of-video-from-full-length-to-yt-shorts/" >digital video games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, digital copies don’t save you money when you buy them, since they are priced for parity with retail. However, that’s not where the savings are to be found. Instead, the killer deal comes from services like <a class="link"   href="https://www.marvel.com/unlimited" >Marvel Unlimited <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I pay $10 a month for access to almost the entire back-catalog of Marvel Comics. Not to mention, even if you do buy comics, there are often sales or bundle deals on platforms like Amazon’s Kindle that do work out cheaper than at a store. Although, I’d still want to visit mom-and-pop comic book stores to look for deals on unsold stock or (in particular) high quality omnibus reprints.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975807/19272" target="_top" id="1975807">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975807" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975807/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Quality-Is-Impeccable"><a href="#The-Quality-Is-Impeccable" class="headerlink" title="The Quality Is Impeccable"></a>The Quality Is Impeccable</h2><p> While paper and printing technology has improved a lot, I really feel that nothing beats the <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >mini-LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on my iPad for reading comics. Most of the digital comics these days are created using extremely high-resolution assets, and they are digital from cradle to grave. When it comes to older comics that were drawn on paper, the scans and restorations that are available beggar belief. This is possibly the best justification of the overkill pixel density of modern tablet displays, more so than video or text. Something I can appreciate on a tablet and not on paper because of my next point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/spider-man-first-appearance.png"                      alt="Spider-Man&#39;s first appearance in Amazing Fantasy."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137412/7443" target="_top" id="2137412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Marvel</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="I-Have-Bad-Eyesight"><a href="#I-Have-Bad-Eyesight" class="headerlink" title="I Have Bad Eyesight"></a>I Have Bad Eyesight</h2><p> I was born with pretty poor eyesight, which means that I often can’t really read small print or appreciate small details on paper without considerable strain. On my iPad, I can pinch and zoom that comic so that one panel fills the entire 12.9-inch screen. Even my eyes can make do with that, and thanks to the aforementioned high-quality assets these comics consist of, there’s detail there for me to enjoy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/x-men-clip.jpg"                      alt="A classic comic book scene featuring Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, and Angel."                > </p><p>Marvel</p><h2 id="Guided-Views-Rocks"><a href="#Guided-Views-Rocks" class="headerlink" title="Guided Views Rocks"></a>Guided Views Rocks</h2><p> Many digital platforms have a “guided view” feature that basically turns each comic page into a series of slides. The screen moves smoothly from one frame to the next, guiding you along the page so that you read and see everything in the correct order. While you can still just read whole pages, I quite enjoy this feature when implemented correctly. Not only because it blows the segments of the page up to a large and easily-readable size, but because it helps make sense of a busy comic page.</p><p> I think for new readers this feature instantly makes comics intelligible and helps move the story forward. Even if you’re a comics veteran, it’s worth trying this out as an alternative way to enjoy comics.</p><h2 id="I-Can’t-Keep-Comic-Series-Straight"><a href="#I-Can’t-Keep-Comic-Series-Straight" class="headerlink" title="I Can’t Keep Comic Series Straight"></a>I Can’t Keep Comic Series Straight</h2><p> At this point in history, many comic book universes are basically a bowl of spaghetti, and when you go to a brick-and-mortar comic store, you’re only looking at the tips of that spaghetti spilling over the rim. You have to order back issues at the store to get what you want, and even if the person behind the counter is an expert, they probably don’t have all the series and issues straight either, and will have to look them up either way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marvel-unlimited.jpg"                      alt="Marvel Unlimited&#39;s app showing currently read comic series."                > </p><p> In contrast, when I open Marvel Unlimited, for example, I can easily select a path through the multiverse of comic issues. I can start with the first issue of Spider-Man (which you aren’t going to buy unless you’re a millionaire) and read it sequentially until the end of that run. Alternatively, I can read curated issues that cover a specific event, like Secret Wars, or just focus on a single character’s chronological adventures. Without this sort of guidance, I’d probably just give up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="I-Read-More-Comics-Than-Ever"><a href="#I-Read-More-Comics-Than-Ever" class="headerlink" title="I Read More Comics Than Ever"></a>I Read More Comics Than Ever</h2><p> Digital comics on my iPad have proven to be so much of a better experience, that I read comics daily. I’m making up for all the stuff I missed in my on-again-off-again dabbling with the medium over the years. There’s such a rich tapestry of fiction to work through, that if giving up paper and ink is what I have to do, I’ll do it gladly.</p><hr><p> That said, reading digital comics on my tablet has actually sparked a desire to buy some physical paper comic books. However, instead of buying the weekly pulp issues, I like high-quality volumes that contain multiple issues or other more premium reprints of important comics. So, in that sense, I also don’t want the little comic book store down the road to go out of business, I just want to buy something a little more upmarket from them, and leave the rest to the digital realm.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-best-camcorders-featuring-direct-faceviewing-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Camcorders Featuring Direct FaceViewing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-sync-video-elements-to-captivate-instagram-audiences/"><u>[New] In 2024, Sync Video Elements to Captivate Instagram Audiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-bringing-anime-characters-to-life-jujutsu-kaisen-for-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Bringing Anime Characters to Life Jujutsu Kaisen for TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-modern-vr-equipment-overview/"><u>2024 Approved Modern VR Equipment Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/best-bluetooth-fm-transmitter-2023-reviews-car-compatibility-and-performance/"><u>Best Bluetooth FM Transmitter (2023 Reviews) - Car Compatibility & Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/eight-crucial-tips-before-investing-in-your-new-tablet/"><u>Eight Crucial Tips Before Investing in Your New Tablet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/1723080810015-explore-the-latest-in-smartwear-the-amazfit-helio-rings-cost-and-features-released/"><u>Explore the Latest in Smartwear: The Amazfit Helio Ring's Cost & Features Released!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-itel-s23plus-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Itel S23+ Like A Pro 5 Easy Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-a-unique-look-with-windows-11-wallpapers/"><u>In 2024, Crafting a Unique Look with Windows 11 Wallpapers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-shining-up-your-videos-on-android/"><u>In 2024, Shining Up Your Videos on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-3-gps-review/"><u>Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 GPS Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/thermaltake-massive-tm-laptop-cooling-pad-review-perk-packed-but-pricey/"><u>Thermaltake Massive TM Laptop Cooling Pad Review: Perk-Packed But Pricey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/tips-and-tricks-for-editing-your-way-to-greatness-in-facebook-reels-for-2024/"><u>Tips and Tricks for Editing Your Way to Greatness in Facebook Reels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/upgrade-your-internet-speed-using-the-netgear-nighthawk-x6s-range-extender/"><u>Upgrade Your Internet Speed Using the Netgear Nighthawk X6S Range Extender</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Star Wars: Squadrons grants you the second of these fantasies to a never before seen degree. This long-overdue follow up to the 1993 classic Star Wars: X-Wing aims to offer the same intense dogfighting, but with the advantages of modern tech. I reviewed the PC version.</p><h2 id="Setup-Some-tinkering-required"><a href="#Setup-Some-tinkering-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Some tinkering required"></a><strong>Setup: Some tinkering required</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons has a fairly hefty download before it’s playable, so be sure your hard drive has at least 26.4 GB of storage space. When the game boots up you can alter basic settings to set language, volume, display settings, and everything else needed to optimize your experience. I struggled a bit to get it to play well with my dual-screen setup, but eventually, I was able to get it to a playable state on my ultra-widescreen Samsung CHG90 display. In the end, I found it more comfortable to play on a standard 16:9 aspect ratio monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1xt9t7ffMjuv6ggtXGJER_irSnk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-2-fcfb7e9a60e74ce9b42cecff0e2061ed.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135403/19272" target="_top" id="2135403">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135403" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135403/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps"><a href="#Story-Passable-but-skip-the-exposition-dumps" class="headerlink" title="Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps"></a><strong>Story: Passable, but skip the exposition dumps</strong></h2><p> The game picks up after the destruction of Alderaan in A New Hope. You get to play both sides of the conflict in alternating story missions as both an Imperial pilot and a Rebel pilot. Both characters are customizable with a range of preset options. I always appreciate it when a game gives me the option to create my own character.</p><p> The range of presets is fairly limited, but welcome nonetheless. As is traditional for me, I chose to rename the protagonists after characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. The Rebel hero became Lu-Tze, with the evil Vorbis on the side of the Empire. I was happy to be able to find a suitably sinister British accent for Vorbis, though hilarious results are possible with mismatched voices and characters. In the end, though, you’ll be spending most of the game from a first-person perspective, with your character only briefly present in cutscenes.</p><p>Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p> Next, you can choose whether you’d like a more guided experience with the standard HUD, or if you’d prefer a more immersive and challenging experience. The game also offers a mode where only your cockpit instruments are displayed. It’s probably a good idea to start off in the standard mode until you get to grips with the controls and gameplay. Lastly, choose your difficulty setting (which will depend on your general experience with flight games), and you’re off to battle.</p><p> Squadrons starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission to teach you how to fly. Though it’s somewhat prolonged, the initial awe of the scenery of an Imperial battlegroup banishes any boredom that you might expect from a tutorial mission. Gliding around Star Destroyers and other classic Star Wars spaceships is quite an experience.</p><p> The story is passable, if not terribly deep or ambitious, and is basically there to connect the battle sequences and give context to the fight. Voice acting varies from mediocre to passable, and there’s clearly some effort put into establishing likeable characters. However, though the character models are good, there’s definitely a bit of the uncanny valley on display here, and it’s particularly noticeable in the first-person conversations where you stare dumbly on as an NPC spouts exposition at you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_MN0adYtaTCJ1Qhmsivk-M-DkXo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-3-31074635684244d48b1d792540a477e2.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> In between story missions you are fixed in place in different rooms, where you click on different characters to talk to them. I found these sequences to be very linear and I found that they tended to drag on. I’d certainly have preferred to be able to walk around rather than teleport between locations on the ship. This is probably due to this game being intended to be played in VR where the fixed positioning makes more sense due to the limitations of VR, but the game would’ve been well served by separate control schemes. This is a minor gripe; if desired you can just skip through these sequences pretty quickly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep"><a href="#Gameplay-Refined-and-surprisingly-deep" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep"></a><strong>Gameplay: Refined and surprisingly deep</strong></h2><p> The real meat of the game is in battle, and it’s an incredibly intense and immersive experience. Whatever system or control method you’re utilizing, there are a lot of different inputs and functions to learn. This would be daunting to newcomers, but the campaign does a great job of gradually introducing new controls and mechanics at a pace that makes them easy to pick up.</p><p> One of the most complex aspects of the game is team and system management, which involves making quick decisions about the layout of your ship and the behaviour of your allies. The basic power systems are easy to master, and simple “attack this” and “defend that” commands aren’t hard to learn, but there are more complicated systems as well that add a level of depth to the game for dedicated players.</p><p> Both the empire and rebels have a range of four classes of ships to choose from - a jack-of-all-trades fighter, a slow bomber with a fearsome arsenal of weapons, a fast and agile interceptor, and a support class ship. I really appreciated that the game doesn’t just make these reskinned mechanically identical clones for each faction. Instead, each side has its unique quirks that affect gameplay, and somehow the designers were still able to balance the game so that neither team feels outgunned by the other.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive. There is some of the traditional looping around in circles, but between the obstacles placed about the map, the different capabilities of the various ships, and the interaction between you and your teammates, this happens only occasionally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/COT6eEVvzd6QqCbhmtbP4a_C--Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-6-9d086810906a486b9266ec247e2ab966-3636fb8670644ae98afd0bc57b59df8d.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The one thing that pulled me out of the game at times was the somewhat wonky ship physics, which make sense from the pilot’s seat, but look a bit weird to see from other ships. You can stop quickly and turn on a dime, which benefits gameplay on a technical level, but is a bit jarring and unrealistic to witness.</p><p> One important aspect of gameplay is how Squadrons balances the fragility of its fighters with creating a fun experience. It does this using shields and repair kits that vary from ship to ship and which can be customized. It walks the fine line between allowing you to mow down enemy fighters without wailing away at them for ages, while also preventing you from feeling like you’re piloting a glass canon.</p><p> There’s also ship customization, which allows you to alter various aspects of your aircraft such as armament, hull, and engines to enhance various attributes, though this usually comes at a cost to other capabilities. For example, you can trade speed for extra agility and vice versa. It requires a deep understanding of the ship you’re customizing so you’ll probably want to wait to touch this till you’ve had plenty of practice in battle. There are also cosmetic customizations, such as paint jobs and ornaments. Both gameplay and cosmetic customizations are purchased with separate types of in-game currency.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is drop-dead gorgeous. Ships are lovingly rendered and great detail was paid to getting the lighting, environments, and effects just right. The cockpits of the different ships you pilot are fully realized and mesmerizing in their realism. It’s easy to get sucked into ogling a grand alien vista or just reveling in the experience of being in the cockpit of an honest to goodness X-Wing. Explosions, lasers, enemy ships tearing apart in fiery gouts of flame, and the realistic damage to your own ship, provoke many tense situations that hit home and are bound to get your heart racing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a-_aXPmbq5vlMG21Sutf0cIe4BI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-7-dc3679df974e4da793c52f2fb2831eac.jpg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972698/19272" target="_top" id="1972698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The game is less attractive in VR, with muddier textures and blurrier skybox, but the trade-off for added immersion is well worth the sacrifice. Actually moving your head to scan around the glass cockpit for enemy fighters and capital ships (or your own wingmates) and then diving in to engage is some of the most fun you can have in VR.</p><h2 id="Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars"><a href="#Audio-Authentic-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Authentic Star Wars"></a><strong>Audio: Authentic Star Wars</strong></h2><p> With the vast majority of video games, your experience is almost as dependent on what you hear as what you see. In this regard, Squadrons is a masterpiece. This game perfectly replicates the epic feel of classic Star Wars space combat from the laser fire, to the roar of your engines, to the exhilarating whoosh of grazing an asteroid. There’s also the unforgettable John Williams soundtrack, which is fully present here and is just as vital to the experience of the game as it is to the films.</p><h2 id="Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs"><a href="#Performance-Solid-on-moderately-powerful-PCs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs"></a><strong>Performance: Solid on moderately powerful PCs</strong></h2><p> I was able to get consistently high frame rates during gameplay with my custom gaming PC running 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor, and an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU. However, I experienced some odd stuttering in the hanger between missions, which seemed more of a graphical bug than an issue with the power of my PC. I also played Squadrons on a laptop with a less powerful processor, 16GB of RAM, and a Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q. The game performed well and provided a smooth gameplay experience at maximum graphical settings.</p><p> Dogfights are fast, brutal, and thanks to a wide variation in map design, each match feels remarkably fresh and non-repetitive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1542129%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1542129/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs"><a href="#Controls-Wide-support-for-different-inputs" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Wide support for different inputs"></a><strong>Controls: Wide support for different inputs</strong></h2><p> Squadrons offers customizable support for a wide range of different control schemes, from gamepads to HOTAS flight sticks to mouse and keyboard. I had to fiddle with a few settings to get my stick and thrust control up and running, but when I did, it added an extra layer of immersion to the experience. However, mouse and keyboard is clearly the optimal and intended control method for Squadrons.</p><h2 id="Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights"><a href="#Multiplayer-Challenging-dogfights" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights"></a><strong>Multiplayer: Challenging dogfights</strong></h2><p> Squadrons features a basic but robust multiplayer mode, the bread and butter of which are team-based dogfights. These are exciting and challenging matches that truly test your skill at the game, and thanks to a decent selection of varied maps it really doesn’t get old.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oKG6kRHcFEOz3O6bwL5_SyeUiEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Star-Wars-Squadrons-4-78947bfe57874d45ae8f401482c3ddf6-379a507c078e44d6898e28d20f53aac9.jpeg"                      alt="Star Wars: Squadrons"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> The other mode features massive large scale multi-stage fleet battles, which require careful team coordination to advance across the battlefield and destroy the enemies’ flagship. It’s a good idea to save this for after you’ve played through most of the campaign, learned the controls, and have tried your hand at a few multiplayer dogfights.</p><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a><strong>Price: Good value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of just $40 Star Wars: Squadrons is a surprisingly reasonably priced game that bucks the trend of modern AAA games uniformly releasing for $60 regardless of what content they are able to offer. It’s not the longest game, and there is a limit to end-game multiplayer content, so $40 is pretty much the exact right price for Squadrons. It’s refreshing to see a distinct lack of any extra monetization in the game, with no annoying microtransactions or loot boxes.</p><h2 id="Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous"><a href="#Star-Wars-Squadrons-vs-Elite-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous"></a><strong>Star Wars: Squadrons vs. Elite Dangerous</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a deeper, more daunting, complex space sim, Elite Dangerous is the next step. Squadrons is far more exciting, being laser-focused on intense aerial combat. Elite Dangerous is a more methodical game, with a focus on exploration and trading, though there’s also exciting combat there if you want it.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> An exhilarating space combat experience that is particularly well suited to VR.</p><p> Star Wars: Squadrons is a fine successor to classic space combat games, and is an undeniably exciting and realistic experience. It’s best if played with a VR headset, but is worth your time and money on a traditional screen as well. The memory of my first flight at the helm of a TIE Fighter in this game has stuck with me with surprising clarity in a way that few moments in video games do, and it’s something you really have to experience for yourself to understand.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Star Wars: Squadrons</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2020</li><li>Rating  Teen</li><li>Platform  PC, PS4, Xbox One</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/solved-surface-book-pro-4-camera-not-working-on-windows-11/"><u>[Solved] Surface Book (Pro 4) Camera Not Working on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-navigating-youtubes-aspect-ratio-landscape-a-complete-tutorial/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating YouTube's Aspect Ratio Landscape A Complete Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-your-2023-guide-best-applications-for-downloading-lite-facebook-videos/"><u>[Updated] Your 2023 Guide Best Applications for Downloading Lite Facebook Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/1726030646857-google/"><u>「Googleドライブでサポート外ファイル種別に関するエラーの修正方法」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-tp-link-av1300-for-wi-fi-coverage-expansion-surprisingly-weak-results/"><u>Evaluating the TP-Link AV1300 for Wi-Fi Coverage Expansion – Surprisingly Weak Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/evaluating-xbox-series-ss-stellar-hardware-and-compact-design-for-gamers/"><u>Evaluating Xbox Series S's Stellar Hardware & Compact Design for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/exclusive-samsung-offers-unbeatable-primes-day-bargains/"><u>Exclusive Samsung Offers: Unbeatable Primes Day Bargains</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/experience-premium-features-on-a-budget-deep-dive-into-insignias-alexa-and-ultra-hd-fire-tv-ns-43df710na19/"><u>Experience Premium Features on a Budget: Deep Dive Into Insignia's Alexa & Ultra HD Fire TV NS-43DF710NA19</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-on-the-preeminent-home-monitoring-device-ring-video-doorbell-2/"><u>Expert Analysis on the Preeminent Home Monitoring Device - Ring Video Doorbell 2.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/the-updated-method-to-bypass-oneplus-12-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Updated Method to Bypass OnePlus 12 FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-top-english-voice-generator-to-convert-text-into-desired-accent/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Top English Voice Generator To Convert Text Into Desired Accent</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The general plot of the game takes place on a different earth. In the past, something called an “Omnic Crisis” occurred. Humans developed AI (Omnics) which grew into sentience. But when the same people who created these Omnics, started to create killer AI, the people came together to form Overwatch.</p><p> Overwatch is a task force created to destroy problematic AI. While this backstory and plot do exist, within the game itself, you don’t really get much of this information. What you’ll see is a variety of super beings who have special abilities, most of which are supported by sci-fi tech. But if you’re interested in knowing it all, be sure to catch up on the animated shorts.</p><h2 id="Modes-and-Competition-A-fun-and-flexible-variety-of-styles-and-heroes"><a href="#Modes-and-Competition-A-fun-and-flexible-variety-of-styles-and-heroes" class="headerlink" title="Modes and Competition: A fun and flexible variety of styles and heroes"></a><strong>Modes and Competition: A fun and flexible variety of styles and heroes</strong></h2><p> Overwatch has a few different game styles you can play. You’ll probably want to try quick play first—and if you’re looking to get into competitive gameplay, you’ll actually be required to play quick play until you reach a certain level. Quick play is the same as competitive, only there is no ranking system, so winning and losing comes with less pressure. That said, Overwatch is still built around measuring how well you do against other players, awarding medals if you do well, and even has a voting system after each map so people can tell you you’re good (or yell at you in chat if you’re doing badly).</p><p> A good team is important in Overwatch, requiring you to use mix of each class—a team of all damage isn’t going to be able to live long enough to make much of a break against a team with tanks and healers.</p><p> There are a few different game types within quick play: Assault, Control, Escort, and Hybrid. Assault involves taking control of two capture points, with one team attacking and one defending. Control is king-of-the-hill with both teams fighting to control a single capture point for a certain amount of time. In Escort, one team must move beside a cart, helping it across a map while the other team defends and tries to stop it. Hybrid mode is simply a combination of Assault and Escort, with at least one capture point and then a payload course after.</p><p> No matter the mode, teams are made up of six heroes. Heroes come in three classes: tank, support, or damage. A good team is important in Overwatch, requiring you to use a mix of each class—a team of all damage isn’t going to be able to live long enough to make much of a break against a team with tanks and healers. It is this idea of team balance that is such a huge part of Overwatch. A lot of that balance comes from players picking the heroes they are strongest with, and you do have some amount of flexibility to change to a different hero should the game warrant it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/geioFj1FYlUVuTIYb9JR3YauwGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4048739-02-39f6f212190b4762a638be5f9fe9c1bf.jpg"                      alt="Overwatch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151889/7443" target="_top" id="2151889">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151889/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specialization-Plenty-of-roles-to-pick-from"><a href="#Specialization-Plenty-of-roles-to-pick-from" class="headerlink" title="Specialization: Plenty of roles to pick from"></a><strong>Specialization: Plenty of roles to pick from</strong></h2><p> This idea of roles or “specializations” is part of what many players likely love about Overwatch—but it is also the biggest critique we have of the game. Most players are put into slots where they mainly play one type of class, and even within that class, often only a set of two or three heroes.</p><p> For example, one might main support and only play Lucio, Mercy, and Ana. This idea can be limiting, because after a certain point, you’re likely to get sick of the classes you’ve focused upon, and after investing so much time into those classes, it’s also a lot of work to move out of them and learn a whole new set. Not only that, but within competitive gameplay, people can be extremely mean if you aren’t playing a class you know, or aren’t performing as well as the other people you are playing with expect you to.</p><p> That said, Overwatch is amazing because of its variety of heroes. There are currently 30 to choose from, which means a lot of variety, unique abilities, and special ultimates. Whether you want to be a fast shooter that zips around, can rewind time and throws bombs, or a giant hamster that can turn into a ball, roll around, and smash things, there is something for everyone.</p><p> Beyond quick play and competitive, there is also an arcade mode, which rotates through different styles of gameplay. This can include capture-the-flag, Lucio ball, mystery heroes, 3 vs. 3 random heroes, and more. Arcade is the least competitive of any of the game modes, but can also be the most unpredictable.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-fast-and-balanced"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-fast-and-balanced" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, fast, and balanced"></a><strong>Gameplay: Fun, fast, and balanced</strong></h2><p> Whether you’re playing quick play, competitive match-making or arcade, the handling and gunplay in Overwatch is smooth. Movements feel responsive and solid, guns feel accurate, and hero abilities are unique with a direct and immediate impact on gameplay. Blizzard also does their best to keep things fresh, putting out<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-maps-in-overwatch-4126097" >new heroes and maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throughout the year, and keeping things balanced between the heroes. If you’re looking for a competitive game with an emphasis on team-play, Overwatch is a very well-made game.</p><p> Blizzard also does their best to keep things fresh, putting out new heroes and maps throughout the year, and keeping things balanced between the heroes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ax5pf76Q9l7kCaVmRsWVAyK3mKw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4048739-04-053ac15b2c4c4a50ad82b5b6a6b84e96.jpg"                      alt="Overwatch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-Stylized-beings-with-bright-colors"><a href="#Graphics-Stylized-beings-with-bright-colors" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Stylized beings with bright colors"></a><strong>Graphics: Stylized beings with bright colors</strong></h2><p> Overwatch has a unique look and feel, consisting of a mix of bright colors and mildly cartoony-looking characters. It works well for the game, which can sometimes feel visually chaotic, especially for new players. But the models are sleek looking, and each of the characters feels like it fits into the same world. Maps are also different and visually interesting, with lots of great details. On top of all this, Overwatch also offers a variety of skins and other in-game cosmetics. You can earn loot boxes by playing the game, or if you want, you can spend money and purchase specific skins. Overall, Overwatch is a graphically clean game, with a touch of artistic flair.</p><p> The models are sleek looking, and each of the characters feels like it fits into the same world. Maps are also different and visually interesting, with lots of great details.</p><h2 id="Price-Lots-of-content-for-the-cost-but-better-with-friends"><a href="#Price-Lots-of-content-for-the-cost-but-better-with-friends" class="headerlink" title="Price: Lots of content for the cost, but better with friends"></a><strong>Price: Lots of content for the cost, but better with friends</strong></h2><p> Overwatch currently costs $19.99 from Blizzard, if you buy the Standard Edition for the PC. Considering the amount of content in the game, and the replayability, Overwatch is worth the price. We’ve spent hundreds of hours playing the game, as the competitive nature could become addicting. There might come a point where it could become stressful. Ultimately, if you want to get the most out of Overwatch for the cost, it’s best to buy the game if you have friends who also want to play. You’ll have a lot more fun playing with people you know than playing with strangers on the internet. This might also help avoid some of the stress of the team-based online play.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-free-to-play-options"><a href="#Competition-Other-free-to-play-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other free-to-play options"></a><strong>Competition: Other free-to-play options</strong></h2><p> Overwatch is very reminiscent of Valve’s popular<a class="link"   href="http://www.teamfortress.com/" >Team Fortress 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but at this time, Team Fortress 2 is a much older game. However, it’s still fun, with hero classes and is a first-person shooter with a less competitive edge.<a class="link"   href="https://www.paladins.com/" >Paladins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another team-based first-person shooter. It also has a class system of heroes, each with unique abilities. In fact, Paladins is basically Overwatch but created by another studio, and made to be free-to-play. So if you’re interested in Overwatch but can’t afford the price, Paladins is a great option worth checking out.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun team-based shooter with unique heroes and lots of replayability.</strong></p><p> Overwatch is a well made and polished game with a variety of game modes and heroes to choose from and plenty of replayability. However, its focus on competition and team play could mean the game can be stressful. For some, this competitive gameplay will be fun and addictive, but for others, it might be overwhelming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105874/7443" target="_top" id="2105874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Overwatch (PlayStation 4)</li><li>Product Brand  Blizzard Entertainment</li><li>Price  $19.99</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-photography-journey-with-vsco-editing-tool/"><u>[New] Ultimate Photography Journey with VSCO Editing Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-compose-captivating-youtube-intros-for-free-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How To Compose Captivating YouTube Intros for FREE for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/2024s-leading-residential-meteorological-devices-reviewed/"><u>2024'S Leading Residential Meteorological Devices Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-the-error-of-unfortunately-the-processcomandroidphone-has-stopped-on-realme-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix the Error of Unfortunately the Process.com.android.phone Has Stopped on Realme 11 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-on-your-vivo-y27-4g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock on your Vivo Y27 4G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/mastery-of-close-up-engagement-on-the-web/"><u>Mastery of Close-Up Engagement on the Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/simplifying-xbox-360-slim-disassembly-a-practical-approach/"><u>Simplifying Xbox 360 Slim Disassembly: A Practical Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-tips-for-buying-a-tablet-based-on-ideal-size-and-easy-mobility/"><u>Top Tips for Buying a Tablet Based on Ideal Size and Easy Mobility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-how-to-restore-sounds-on-a-realtek-audio-device-after-silence/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide: How to Restore Sounds on a Realtek Audio Device After Silence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/understanding-the-speed-and-performance-of-tp-link-archer-c80-top-sub-100-routers/"><u>Understanding the Speed & Performance of TP-Link Archer C80 - Top Sub-$100 Routers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unlock-convenience-a-review-of-mods-newest-and-simplest-electric-bike-with-a-sidecar/"><u>Unlock Convenience: A Review of Mod's Newest and Simplest Electric Bike with a Sidecar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unlocking-literary-worlds-on-a-budget-the-all-inclusive-review-of-the-2nd-amazon-kindle-for-2019/"><u>Unlocking Literary Worlds on a Budget: The All-Inclusive Review of the 2nD Amazon Kindle for 2019!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/user-satisfaction-report-on-the-popular-gps-cycling-and-running-app-mapmyride/"><u>User Satisfaction Report on the Popular GPS Cycling & Running App, MapMyRide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Right Camera Accessories in 2024"></a>Finding the Right Camera Accessories in 2024</h2><p> When choosing gear, it’s important to consider how and what you shoot. Are you a landscape photographer, or do you prefer sports photography? One will need a steady, rugged tripod while the other might benefit from investing in a good camera strap.</p><p> Evaluating your needs as a photographer will not only help you choose the best photo accessories for you, it’ll keep you from spending money on stuff you’ll never use.</p><p> Though your needs will vary, there are a few items just about every photographer can benefit from including in their kit. A good sturdy camera bag, for example, and a strong tripod. Let’s not forget a rock-solid memory card that you know will keep your images safe until you can get home to back them up. These are the small but essential items you may not consider when getting into photography but will end up needing.</p><p> Here we’ll go over the broader categories of camera accessories, from backpacks to memory cards, to help you choose some solid options to build out your kit. Because there are so many great options out there, we stuck to the ones we thought would make the best all-around or introductory pieces of kit.</p><p> Keep them for years or use them as a stepping stone—either way, you’ll find something in our list of top photography gear you can use.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>5</td><td>45</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

You can also position the legs to 55 and 80 degrees with maximum load capacities of 44lbs (20kg) and 22lbs (10kg) respectively.

If you’re buying type B cards, go for higher-capacity options—the smaller cards are cheaper, but they have slower write speeds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prograde.png"                      alt="prograde"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best CFexpress Card</p><h5 id="Prograde-Digital-CFexpress-2-0-Gold-Memory-Card"><a href="#Prograde-Digital-CFexpress-2-0-Gold-Memory-Card" class="headerlink" title="Prograde Digital CFexpress 2.0 Gold Memory Card"></a>Prograde Digital CFexpress 2.0 Gold Memory Card</h5><p>If you need a great CFexpress card for heavy-duty professional use, the Prograde Gold line will serve you well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/ProGrade-Digital-256GB-CFexpress-Memory/dp/B0863981FZ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206986&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/784547/best-camera-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$128 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-SD-Card-SanDisk-Extreme-Pro-UHS-I-64-GB"><a href="#Best-SD-Card-SanDisk-Extreme-Pro-UHS-I-64-GB" class="headerlink" title="Best SD Card: SanDisk Extreme Pro UHS I (64 GB)"></a>Best SD Card: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9J1YXN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206986&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/784547/best-camera-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >SanDisk Extreme Pro UHS I (64 GB) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9J1YXN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206986&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/784547/best-camera-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9J1YXN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206986&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/784547/best-camera-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sandisk-SD.jpg"                      alt="SanDisk SD card on pink background"                > SanDisk</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H9J1YXN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206986&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/784547/best-camera-accessories/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Great value for the price</td><td>✗ Not as fast as newer formats like CFexpress</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Among the faster SD cards you can buy</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ 64GB lets you fit a lot on the card without putting all your eggs in one basket</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> If you’re shooting one of the myriad cameras that still only takes <a class="link"   href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-high-quality-video-webcams-top-5-combos-with-sound/" >SD cards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but you still need speed, not to worry.

The watch lets kids communicate with parents and other caregivers via SMS and voice calls, has live GPS tracking via the NickWatch app, and has a ton of activities and games with Nickelodeon characters like SpongeBob and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The company promises regular content updates, too, which could help your kiddo avoid boredom with seeing the same stuff over and over.</p><p> “NickWatch is a true disruptor in the wearable tech category for kids, combining world-class Nickelodeon content with unrivaled parental controls and features,” said Udi Miron, CEO at Watchinu,<a class="link"   href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/watchinu-brings-award-winning-nickelodeon-smartwatch-for-kids-to-the-us-302195353.html" >in a statement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . “We are bringing to market a smartwatch that is not only fun and enriching, but will grow with the children who wear them for years to come.”</p><p> The idea is to empower your kids’ independence while keeping them safe, of course, and the NickWatch app offers a subscription ($8 - $13 per month) to do just that with location tracking and communication tools. You can also create an area you want your kids to stay in (a geofence) and get a notification if they go past those boundaries. Parents and caregivers can even mute the watch during school hours and manage who can chat with their kiddo on the watch.</p><p> The NickWatch will retail or $119. It will be available at Walmart.com Saturday, July 13, and should appear in Walmart stores starting in October.  </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/nickWatch-by-nickelodeon/6344272802" >$119 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-smartwatch-8666142" >5 Things to Consider Before You Buy a Smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-visionary-video-snatcher-tools-guide/"><u>[New] In 2024, Visionary Video Snatcher Tools Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-unparalleled-screenplay-craftsmanship-across-varied-fields/"><u>[New] Unparalleled Screenplay Craftsmanship Across Varied Fields</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/additional-tips-about-sinnoh-stone-for-sony-xperia-1-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Additional Tips About Sinnoh Stone For Sony Xperia 1 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/discover-the-redesigned-look-of-microsofts-online-office-tools-an-updated-user-interface/"><u>Discover the Redesigned Look of Microsoft's Online Office Tools - An Updated User Interface</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/expert-video-editing-techniques-for-instagram-success/"><u>Expert Video Editing Techniques for Instagram Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-basics-what-is-a-dac-and-is-it-necessary-for-your-audio-setup/"><u>Exploring the Basics: What Is a DAC and Is It Necessary for Your Audio Setup?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/1722922115643-horizon-hours-the-ultimate-guide-to-automotive-engineering-books-and-blogs-edition-in-new-york-city-book-five-of-fourth-series/"><u>Horizon Hours - The Ultimate Guide to Automotive Engineering Books & Blogs Edition in New York City, Book Five of Fourth Series!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-vivo-t2-5g-to-outlook-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Vivo T2 5G to Outlook | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/understanding-the-benefits-of-garmin-vivosmart-4-comprehensive-review-on-health-monitoring-features/"><u>Understanding the Benefits of Garmin Vivosmart 4: Comprehensive Review on Health Monitoring Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/uninspired-launch-for-godfall-why-sonys-only-ps5-exclusive-falls-short/"><u>Uninspired Launch for Godfall: Why Sony's Only PS5 Exclusive Falls Short</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-differences-between-ipad-and-ipad-air-models/"><u>Unraveling the Differences Between iPad and iPad Air Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-ps4-pros-potential-the-quest-for-ultimate-4k-gaming-experience/"><u>Unveiling PS4 Pro's Potential: The Quest for Ultimate 4K Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/vikings-adventure-and-betrayal-a-comprehensive-review-of-assassins-creed-valhalla-in-the-medieval-landscape/"><u>Vikings, Adventure & Betrayal: A Comprehensive Review of Assassin's Creed Valhalla in the Medieval Landscape</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none;

As streaming services have become commonplace, some subscribers don’t have access to live TV and broadcast channels. Some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provide advanced features, but their designs leave something to be desired. I tested the attractive Antop AT-127 Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a worthy option.</p><h2 id="Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish"><a href="#Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish" class="headerlink" title="Design: Reversible faux wood finish"></a><strong>Design: Reversible faux wood finish</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 is one of the better-looking antennas I’ve come across. It’s a thin, plastic rectangular antenna that measures 13 inches wide by nine inches tall. At 0.02 inches in thickness, it’s almost paper-thin, but the plastic feels sturdy enough to withstand regular wear and tear.</p><p> The antenna is reversible, with a light oak finish on one side, and darker wood color on the other. It looks less like an eyesore or something you need to hide, and more like an attractive component, you’re willing to display. The pre-attached coaxial cable comes out of the bottom, which is ideal. You can’t remove the cable from the antenna, which isn’t great for storage, but it does promote stable connectivity.</p><p> The antenna comes with a stand for placement on a desk or entertainment center. It also comes with double-sided adhesives, so you can hang it on a wall or window. The adhesives are extremely sticky—when I pulled the antenna off of my wall, the paint came off along with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RWXekalxAMy_w61EH_Getqbfiy0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-2-24f94c63d6164dc7a54542cc1e4262c9.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Easier-than-most"><a href="#Setup-Easier-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Easier than most"></a><strong>Setup: Easier than most</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is relatively intuitive. You just connect the antenna to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connection on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to twist onto the threading. This makes for easier setup because you don’t have to struggle behind your TV with trying to screw on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/coaxial-vs-optical-digital-cable-3134605" >coaxial cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Once you connect the antenna’s cable to your TV, you’ll need to find the best placement. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the setup process. My test home is in a wooded area, and I found the best placement was near or directly on the window. However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >to improve your antenna’s reception <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s usually a good idea to place the antenna high up in a room close to the home’s exterior (and nearest to the transmitter towers) and to avoid obstacles like walls and tree cover.</p><p> The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to screw onto the coax threading.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982456">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982456">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982456%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982456/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 supports UHF and VHF signals.
