If you’re constantly looking for supplemental commentary to the news—be it politics or sports—there’s an abundance of options available on SiriusXM.</p><p> I’m a big baseball fan so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to listen to every game live. Additionally, the MLB Network Radio station provides something baseball-related 24&#x2F;7. There are individual teams’ podcasts and shows mixed in that I found too. There were always people talking about baseball in some fashion. This is also true for other sports like the NBA and NFL.</p><p> During my time with the service, the Wimbledon Championship was going on and I listened to some of that, even though I didn’t care much about tennis.</p><p> Beyond sports, I dabbled in the comedy section, which was fun, but not typically my thing. There’s a robust true crime selection of shows that could keep certain people busy.</p><p> Some of this non-music content is exclusive to SiriusXM, but not all of it. If you know your way around a podcast app, you can find similar types of sports, comedy, and true crime content for free (usually with ads). But that can be a pain to keep up with. I liked how easy it was to bookmark different stations and flip around between the different ones in the app when I needed to fill 15 minutes during a car ride.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Streaming-Music-For-the-Lean-Back-Listeners"><a href="#Streaming-Music-For-the-Lean-Back-Listeners" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Music For the Lean-Back Listeners"></a>Streaming Music For the Lean-Back Listeners</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/music-stations-on-siriusxm.jpg"                      alt="music stations on SiriusXM"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Although I think the collection of non-music content is the standout feature of SiriusXM, the music side still plays a big role in its value. It’s very much like traditional radio though, instead of an on-demand music service.</p><p> You can skip songs, but only so many per station in a certain time frame. Personally, I need the ability to select individual songs and listen to them at a moment’s notice. You can’t do that with SiriusXM. But not everyone rolls like that.</p><p> I know several people who have access to Apple Music but never use it because they just don’t want to spend the time sifting around. They listen to whatever is playing on the local radio station in the car instead.</p><p> They prefer the lean-back listening experience and would rather have a DJ or algorithm pick the songs instead of making those decisions. That’s not a bad thing either!</p><p> I was able to put on various pop, rock, and indie stations (including a TikTok one) throughout the day and hear plenty of old and new songs I enjoyed. Pandora radio is integrated into SiriusXM so if you’re familiar with that music service you’ll feel at home with how it works.</p><p> While some fresh songs did pop up throughout my listening, I didn’t hear as many as I would have liked. For example, one Friday, I opened SiriusXM looking for that day’s new music releases and was disappointed by the lack of any visible promotion or stations with exclusively new music from artists like Clario, Griff, Eminem, and Remi Wolf, among others.</p><p> The closest thing I saw was a banner for “Shade 45” Eminem’s hip-hop channel. But beyond being one of six advertised stations, there was nothing to indicate that the rapper had a new album out.</p><p> I point this out to emphasize my point that SiriusXM really is geared towards people who don’t know what they want to listen to or don’t care too much about the individual songs that play.</p><p> For better or worse, there are limited music discovery options to decide between. You pretty much just have to pick a genre and then decide whether you’re feeling energetic or lazy. SiriusXM will pick a good selection of songs from that point forward.</p><p> If you want to dig deeper you can sift through more nuanced styles, events, or prompts. There are probably enough options for people who do get adventurous once in a while, but there aren’t a lot of drastic changes regularly shaking up the interface.</p><p> If you begin skipping too many songs while listening, you’ll be interrupted by suggestions for other, similar, stations. Beyond the underlying royalty structure, the thought is that if you’re skipping too many songs you may not be on the right radio station.</p><p> As annoying as that was a couple of times, there were a few times I did end up switching stations because I realized I was actually in the mood to listen to something else. Not all stations allow songs to be skipped though.</p><p> Unfortunately, when you do hit on a song you like, the only option is to save the artist to your library as a new inspiration for a radio station of similar artists. There’s no way to save the song to remember later. It’s all very ephemeral. The interface is simple in this way. You can’t make playlists, view lyrics, or do things with individual songs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136617/26400" target="_top" id="2136617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136617/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Subscribe-to-SiriusXM"><a href="#Should-You-Subscribe-to-SiriusXM" class="headerlink" title="Should You Subscribe to SiriusXM?"></a>Should You Subscribe to SiriusXM?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/media-player-on-siriusxm-app.jpg"                      alt="media player on SiriusXM app"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> If you stumbled onto this article wondering if <a class="link"   href="https://siriusxm.zgkv.net/c/156932/2017972/4694?subId1=HTGReview" >SiriusXM All Access <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a valid option to listen to ad-free music whenever you want to, without being stressed out by the choices, then yes, it’s a valid option to consider. You can use the mobile app to listen in the car (over Bluetooth), around the house with Sonos speakers, or connect to any Bluetooth speaker. There are music options for nearly every occasion available with a push of a single button.</p><p> On the other hand, if you’re seriously shopping between Apple Music and Spotify for the best music service with unlimited song selections, SiriusXM probably isn’t for you. Its benefits are less tailored to someone wanting to build playlists and select individual songs.</p><p> More than music though, my general blanket recommendation is that SiriusXM is for people who want to listen to talk and sports radio a lot of the day, but who wouldn’t mind ad-free music occasionally. If that’s you, this service is an ideal choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/siriusxm-profile.jpg"                      alt="SiriusXM Profile"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/htg-staff-pick-1.png"                                     > </p><h5 id="SiriusXM-1"><a href="#SiriusXM-1" class="headerlink" title="SiriusXM"></a>SiriusXM</h5><p>7&#x2F; 10 </p><p>SiriusXM features expertly curated ad-free music, celebrity-hosted talk, sports analysis, and more.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://siriusxm.zgkv.net/c/156932/2017972/4694?subId1=HTGReview" >$9.99 at SiriusXM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-knowledge-keepers-premier-10-tools-to-record-teaching-sessions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Knowledge Keepers Premier 10 Tools to Record Teaching Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-insider-writers-on-popular-tiktok-wallpapers/"><u>[New] Insider' Writers on Popular TikTok Wallpapers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/rofessional-editing-strategies-for-youtube-videos-after-upload/"><u>[New] Professional Editing Strategies for YouTube Videos After Upload</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-secretive-story-viewing-tactics-for-android-iphone-and-pc-for-2024/"><u>[New] Secretive Story Viewing Tactics for Android, iPhone & PC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-net-booster-fb-stories-repository-app/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Net Booster FB Stories Repository App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/2019-kindle-oasis-evaluation-the-ultimate-guide-to-a-smooth-paper-felt-read/"><u>2019 Kindle Oasis Evaluation: The Ultimate Guide to a Smooth, Paper-Felt Read</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/amazon-fire-hd-8-gen-8-review-an-economical-tablet-that-delivers-on-its-promises-for-the-price-point/"><u>Amazon Fire HD 8 Gen 8 Review: An Economical Tablet that Delivers on Its Promises for the Price Point</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/1723034124714-exciting-fortnite-chapter-return-an-engaging-review-of-the-fresh-seasons-thrills/"><u>Exciting Fortnite Chapter Return: An Engaging Review of the Fresh Season's Thrills!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/exploring-monster-hunter-world-strategies-for-defeating-formidable-creatures/"><u>Exploring Monster Hunter: World - Strategies for Defeating Formidable Creatures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/process-of-screen-sharing-samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-to-pc-detailed-steps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Process of Screen Sharing Samsung Galaxy M34 5G to PC- Detailed Steps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-capabilities-of-the-garmin-gpsmap-n-series-for-enthusiastic-explorers/"><u>Unveiling the Capabilities of the Garmin GPSMAP N Series for Enthusiastic Explorers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-elegance-of-taotronics-a-comprehensive-review-of-the-tt-dl1nngled-in-style/"><u>Unveiling the Elegance of TaoTronics: A Comprehensive Review of the TT-DL1nngled in Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/voice-and-silence-integrated-the-future-in-b550-xt/"><u>Voice & Silence Integrated: The Future in B550-XT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/voice-log-export-and-critique-for-2024/"><u>Voice Log Export & Critique for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/which-smartphone-wins-comparing-iphones-and-androids-for-ideal-user-satisfaction/"><u>Which Smartphone Wins?: Comparing iPhones and Androids for Ideal User Satisfaction</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

title="What to Look for in a Galaxy S22+ Case in 2024"></a>What to Look for in a Galaxy S22+ Case in 2024</h2><p> The Galaxy S22+, like many other high-end smartphones, uses a glass sandwich design. While it looks great, any glass-sandwich phone is delicate. If you want to keep the phone in tip-top shape, picking up a case is a good idea.</p><p> However, as different consumers have different needs, there is no single case to rule them all. This is why the case manufacturers release cases in multiple form factors. As a result, you’ll find slim, rugged, wallet, leather, and clear cases on the market.</p><p> While the slim or thin cases add the least amount of bulk, there also typically provide the least protection. If bulk is a concern for you, thin cases are your best friend. But if you need protection due to your lifestyle or workplace, you’ll want to get a more rugged case.</p><p> Similarly, clear cases are ideal for showing off the phone’s design, and wallet cases help you keep everything you need in one place.</p><p> Additionally, raised edges for screen protection, wireless charging support, and easy access to the ports are features that you may want to look for in any prospective case. While most cases will have these features, it’s a good idea to make sure the case of your choice does to avoid disappointment.</p><p> With the basics out of the way, it’s time to dive into our recommendations.</p><p> The cases below will only work with the Galaxy S22+.

But if you’re looking for some protection without bulk, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Thin-Designed-Galaxy-Plus/dp/B09JFGR124?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206850&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/786899/best-samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-case/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Spigen Thin Fit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is our pick for the best thin Galaxy S22+ case.</p><p> The case is primarily made out of polycarbonate, but it uses some TPU material in the border. While the polycarbonate helps the case resist scratches and withstand impact, the TPU adds much-needed flexibility for installation and removal.</p><p> The Thin Fit adds barely any bulk to the phone but still offers a reasonable level of protection. It also features raised edges and has a matte, soft-touch finish that feels nice in hand and helps with the grip.</p><p> One of the drawbacks of the Spigen Thin Fit is its affinity with fingerprint grease. The case picks up fingerprint smudges very quickly. Additionally, it’s available in only one color and has a pretty bland look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/spigen-thin-fit.png"                      alt="Spigen Thin Fit"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Thin Galaxy S22+ Case</p><h5 id="Spigen-Thin-Fit-1"><a href="#Spigen-Thin-Fit-1" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Thin Fit"></a>Spigen Thin Fit</h5><p>$16 $25 Save $9 </p><p>The Spigen Thin Fit is a great thin case that we like.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657386/16446" target="_top" id="1657386">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657386" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657386/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result.

It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136620/26400" target="_top" id="2136620">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136620" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136620/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135364/19272" target="_top" id="2135364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135364/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-selection-of-android-and-ios-wedding-timer-apps-reviewed/"><u>[New] Ultimate Selection of Android and iOS Wedding Timer Apps Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-choices-for-premium-video-calls-on-smartphones-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Choices for Premium Video Calls on Smartphones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-the-efficiency-of-modern-tunefab-recorders-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring the Efficiency of Modern Tunefab Recorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-the-cutest-10-video-compressors-available-on-google-play/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Discover the Cutest 10 Video Compressors Available on Google Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-periscope-review/"><u>2024 Approved Periscope Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streaming-success-without-xsplit/"><u>2024 Approved Streaming Success Without Xsplit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-excellence-a-comprehensive-review-of-the-arcshell-ar-5/"><u>Affordable Excellence: A Comprehensive Review of the Arcshell AR-5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/capturing-clarity-on-camera-an-insightful-review-of-google-pixel-6/"><u>Capturing Clarity on Camera?

Instead, I <a class="link"   href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/complete-guide-step-by-step-process-of-removing-a-twitch-profile/" >undervolted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the GPU @925mV and applied a +1000MHz memory overclock shortly after buying it. With those settings, my GPU has been running cooler and using less power than with the default settings for about a year.</p><p> Later, I reverted the memory clock to default because the performance gains from running overclocked memory were minuscule. I have been daily driving the 925mV undervolt with default memory clocks for more than two and a half years now.</p><p> Naturally, I wanted to find out whether the automatic overclock gave my GPU any performance boost. So I decided to test my GPU with three different configurations: the 925mV undervolt, default GPU settings, and the NVIDIA App’s automatic overclock applied.</p><p> Here are my 3DMark <em>Time Spy</em> benchmark results (each score is an average of three runs):</p><ul><li><strong>GPU Undervolt:</strong> 13,849</li><li><strong>Default GPU settings:</strong> 13,841</li><li><strong>Auto OC:</strong> 13,956</li></ul><p> As you can see, the worst result is the one with default settings. When undervolted, my RTX 3070 scored higher than with default settings while running cooler, quieter, and using less power.</p><p> With the auto overclock applied, the GPU has achieved the highest overall score. That said, the score isn’t significantly higher than in other instances. I estimate that the real-world performance boost in games would be less than 5%.</p><p> Personally, I’ve decided to continue daily driving my 920mV undervolt because I didn’t get much higher performance while my GPU did sound louder when running <em>Time Spy</em> overclocked.</p><p> For what it’s worth, I got my GPU at the height of <a class="link"   href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/fix-libcea32dll-not-found-issues-a-stepwise-approach-for-users/" >the infamous chip shortage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which resulted in buying the cheapest RTX 3070 model available. The Gigabyte RTX 3070 Eagle OC that I picked up has a fairly poor cooling solution. I reckon that if you’ve got a higher-quality GPU with a better cooling setup and a more robust voltage regulating module (VRM), you’ll probably get a better result when using the NVIDIA app to overclock your card.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Overclocking-Your-GPU-Can-Damage-It"><a href="#Overclocking-Your-GPU-Can-Damage-It" class="headerlink" title="Overclocking Your GPU Can Damage It"></a>Overclocking Your GPU Can Damage It</h2><p> You should be aware that the Automatic Tuning utility has a very slim chance of messing up your graphics card. In fact, there’s always a slim chance of breaking your GPU or CPU when overclocking it. That said, the chance of anything going south is minuscule because modern GPUs and CPUs have built-in safety features that turn the chip off when a higher-than-normal temperature or power usage is detected.</p><p> The catch with Automatic Tuning is that even if it messes up your GPU, your warranty won’t be voided because you’ve used an official NVIDIA app. Of course, you’ll need to be in the valid warranty period for this to apply.</p><p> If you manually <a class="link"   href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-android-screen-recorders-essential-app-selection/" >overclock your graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a third-party tool like <a class="link"   href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-guide-on-faking-your-location-in-mozilla-firefox-on-oppo-find-x7-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >MSI Afterburner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you end up breaking it, your warranty will be void if you say you had overclocked your GPU before it died.</p><p> In other words, you can keep the warranty if you just don’t <em>say</em> you were overclocking your GPU. The good news is that there isn’t a way for NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel to determine whether overclocking is to blame. So, as long as you keep quiet about your overclocking adventures, you should be fine.</p><hr><p> The Automatic Tuning feature found on the NVIDIA App is an easy-to-use auto overclock tool that allows even the least experienced PC newbies to get a few extra frames in their favorite games without having to know anything about GPU overclocking. It’s simple to use, and while it doesn’t offer much performance gain, I recommend at least trying it.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-professional-guidelines-for-text-overlays-vimeo-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Professional Guidelines for Text Overlays (Vimeo) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/easy-installation-guide-logitech-g430-driver-update-for-optimal-sound-experience/"><u>Easy Installation Guide: Logitech G430 Driver Update for Optimal Sound Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/guia-facil-para-insertar-subtitulos-en-su-pelicula-y-usar-archivos-srt/"><u>Guía Fácil Para Insertar Subtítulos en Su Película Y Usar Archivos SRT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-samsung-galaxy-a24-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Samsung Galaxy A24 Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/remove-the-lock-screen-fingerprint-of-your-samsung-galaxy-a05-by-drfone-android/"><u>Remove the Lock Screen Fingerprint Of Your Samsung Galaxy A05</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/sleek-design-impressive-performance-discover-the-excellence-of-acer-aspire-c27-all-in-one-computer/"><u>Sleek Design, Impressive Performance – Discover the Excellence of Acer Aspire C27 All-in-One Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/1723009247593-solution-tips-for-updating-outdated-drivers-in-minecraft-get-back-to-playing/"><u>Solution Tips for Updating Outdated Drivers in Minecraft – Get Back to Playing!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-economical-earbud-epic-unpacking-the-oneplus-experience/"><u>The Economical Earbud Epic - Unpacking the OnePlus Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-finest-fit-exploring-cost-efficient-pet-camera-options/"><u>The Finest Fit: Exploring Cost-Efficient Pet Camera Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-linksys-ea9500-experience-high-performance-internet-gateway-with-smart-connectivity/"><u>The Linksys EA9500 Experience: High-Performance Internet Gateway with Smart Connectivity</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144288/7443" target="_top" id="2144288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144288/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices"><a href="#Performance-Fast-charging-for-demanding-devices" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices"></a><strong>Performance: Fast charging for demanding devices</strong></h2><p> The best part of the Anker PowerDrive 2 is its charging. It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive. It’s hard to ask for much more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139110/17108" target="_top" id="2139110">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139110" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139110/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  PowerDrive 2 24W Dual USB Car Charger</li><li>Product Brand  Anker</li><li>SKU  848061073508</li><li>Price  $14.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  2.6 x 1.1 x 1.1 in.</li><li>Ports  2</li><li>Warranty  18-month</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-key-elements-in-achieving-proficient-interview-performance/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Key Elements in Achieving Proficient Interview Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-youtube-mastery-screen-recording-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved YouTube Mastery Screen Recording Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-acquire-and-setup-windows-xp-movie-creator/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Acquire & Setup Windows XP Movie Creator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/advanced-mobility-reinvented-dive-into-the-lenovo-thinkpad-z13-gen-2s-amd-powerhouse-performance-review/"><u>Advanced Mobility Reinvented: Dive Into the Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2'S (AMD) Powerhouse Performance Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/ais-intellectual-ladder-high-to-low-rungs/"><u>AI's Intellectual Ladder: High to Low Rungs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/boosting-youtube-descriptions-with-expert-templates/"><u>Boosting YouTube Descriptions with Expert Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-sea-techs-portable-usb-blu-ray-recorder-a-look-at-its-erratic-effectiveness/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of Sea Tech's Portable USB Blu-Ray Recorder -

This allows for an even more compact personal computer, and the Pi 400 kit even includes a microSD card with the OS preloaded.

Here’s my full review of the Raspberry Pi 400.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-PC-inside-of-a-keyboard"><a href="#Design-A-PC-inside-of-a-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Design: A PC inside of a keyboard"></a>Design: A PC inside of a keyboard</h2><p> Previous versions of the Raspberry Pi didn’t exactly come across as accessible to the typical PC user who spends most of their time surfing the web. The older Raspberry Pi models look like a mini motherboard with ports and other components attached. The Raspberry Pi 400 is completely different, as the board is housed inside a keyboard for easier setup and use. It’s reminiscent of those all-in-one PC keyboards from the 80s.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7BA0HRUVuCSmbiMi4uyFWkXVuKg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Raspberry-Pi-400-Mini-PC-3-58854ebe9d964ccc984e44f77619fa1a.jpg"                      alt="Raspberry Pi 400"                ></p><p>Erika Rawes &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The Pi 400 just includes the keyboard PC, but if you go with the Pi 400 kit, it includes a USB mouse, a power supply, a mini HDMI to HDMI cable, a guide on how to use the Pi, and most importantly, a microSD card with the Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Rasbian) pre-installed. The kit also provides a full-sized SD card adapter for transferring and loading software from your main computer. The PC-in-a-keyboard design makes the Pi 400 Kit less like a computer you have to build, and more like a PC you can start using right out of the box. It also means the Pi can compete with other, more expensive mini PCs.</p><p> The Pi keyboard is small, but it’s still usable. It’s about the size of a typical Bluetooth keyboard that you’d buy for a tablet, as it measures about 11 inches wide and just under 5 inches in depth. The red and white design doesn’t really match most monitors, but it still looks sleek. And, the included mouse goes well with the keyboard, with the same color scheme.</p><p> On the back of the Pi 400, you’ll find a slot for the microSD card, as well as all of the ports. It has two micro HDMI slots, three USB slots (two 3.0 and one 2.0), a horizontal 40-pin GPIO header, and the port for the power supply. The power button is on the keyboard itself—press F10 to power on the Pi, and press Fn + F10 to power it off.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easier-than-previous-Pi-models"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easier-than-previous-Pi-models" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easier than previous Pi models"></a>Setup Process: Easier than previous Pi models</h2><p> The Raspberry Pi 400 is still…well, a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/raspberry-pi-4102621" >Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It isn’t a traditional PC in the sense that it doesn’t have full capabilities like a typical laptop,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or even mini computer. The Pi is just a computer—it doesn’t even have an operating system unless you add one (fortunately, this Pi includes the OS with the kit). Even when you add the OS, the Pi has a relatively barebones interface. The whole purpose of a Raspberry Pi is to be whatever you want it to be—a personal computer, a smart home controller, a gaming system, or whatever else you can think of.</p><p> The keyboard made setup easier, as did the additional accessories in the kit. I just had to put the microSD card in the keyboard’s slot, connect the mouse and power supply, connect the keyboard to a monitor, and power on the Pi. After some updates, I was up and running.</p><p> The whole purpose of a Raspberry Pi is to be whatever you want it to be—a personal computer, a smart home controller, a gaming system, or whatever else you can think of.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137229/26400" target="_top" id="2137229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137229/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Projects-Keyboard-helps-in-some-ways-hinders-in-others"><a href="#Projects-Keyboard-helps-in-some-ways-hinders-in-others" class="headerlink" title="Projects: Keyboard helps in some ways, hinders in others"></a>Projects: Keyboard helps in some ways, hinders in others</h2><p> One great thing about<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-raspberry-pi-4042337" >Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that there’s a community of users to help you out with project ideas, to share terminal commands, and to help with troubleshooting. Pi computers are great for makers, but once I really started experimenting with the Pi 400, I realized the keyboard is beneficial in some areas, but it’s limiting in others.</p><p> You can create a streaming system or RetroPie Gaming System pretty easily with the Pi 400, and you don’t even need to attach a keyboard when you need to add content or perform updates. However, the keyboard form factor prevents you from putting the Pi inside of a mini Nintendo-style case like you can with the Pi 3.</p><p> It would be difficult to make anything outdoors with a keyboard, and it would be tough to use the Pi as a security camera when it’s inside of a keyboard. You can remove the Pi from the keyboard if you really want to, but that would kind of defeat the purpose of going with the 400 model. Instead of removing the board, you could just opt for a Pi 4, although it has a lower CPU clock (1.5 Ghz).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oideXrFtpj_WzRtq1qacMhsc7Dg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Raspberry-Pi-400-Mini-PC-2-6fbd163b7ed849f684963b93ae8b8735.jpg"                      alt="Raspberry Pi 400"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947750/11832" target="_top" id="947750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947750/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Erika Rawes &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Display-Dual-mini-HDMI-ports"><a href="#Display-Dual-mini-HDMI-ports" class="headerlink" title="Display: Dual mini HDMI ports"></a>Display: Dual mini HDMI ports</h2><p> The Pi 400 has two mini HDMI slots, so you could connect two displays if you wanted to. It can display in 4K as well, which is impressive for a mini PC under $100.</p><p> The Raspberry Pi 400 doesn’t have a DSI port for connecting a capacitive touchscreen display, but you can connect just about any compatible HDMI monitor as long as you use a micro HDMI to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-cables-and-connectors-what-you-need-to-know-4685377" >HDMI cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Performance-Not-bad-for-the-size"><a href="#Performance-Not-bad-for-the-size" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Not bad for the size"></a>Performance: Not bad for the size</h2><p> The Pi 400 is the fastest Pi yet, with a 1.8GHz quad-core processor (compared to 1.5GHz on the previous model Pi 4). It doesn’t feel sluggish when booting up, nor does it lag when moving between different applications.</p><p> Because this is a Pi, running benchmarks was a bit of a pain because the OS is small and open-source, so it isn’t ready to run benchmarking tools on a whim. I was able to install Phoronix Test Suite and run a few benchmark tests, including C-Ray 1.1 and a few others. On C-Ray, it earned a moderate score of 561.26. When idle, the Pi ran at a temperature of around 34 degrees Celsius. It has good thermal architecture, with a heatsink inside the keyboard to keep the system cool.</p><p> The PC-in-a-keyboard design makes the Pi 400 Kit less like a computer you have to build, and more like a PC you can start using right out of the box.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Minecraft-Pi-RetroPie-and-more"><a href="#Gaming-Minecraft-Pi-RetroPie-and-more" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Minecraft Pi, RetroPie, and more"></a>Gaming: Minecraft Pi, RetroPie, and more</h2><p> The Raspberry Pi 400 Kit with the included Raspberry Pi OS card has a few games preloaded, like Soccer, Boing, Bunner, and Minecraft Pi. Minecraft Pi lets you build Minecraft style, while also learning about programming languages.</p><p> You can turn your Raspberry Pi 400 into a RetroPie gaming system, where you can play classic games from Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Sega, Atari, and more. I created a RetroPie using a Raspberry Pi 3 a few years back, and I’d have to connect a keyboard for any updates or changes. The new keyboard form factor makes things a bit easier with the Pi 400.</p><h2 id="Productivity-LibreOffice-and-helpful-accessories"><a href="#Productivity-LibreOffice-and-helpful-accessories" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: LibreOffice and helpful accessories"></a>Productivity: LibreOffice and helpful accessories</h2><p> The Kit with the included Raspberry Pi OS has LibreOffice applications preloaded. You get LibreOffice Base, Calc, Draw, Impress, Math, and Writer. This is helpful for homework, work, keeping track of your command lines, basic word processing, or for creating spreadsheets.</p><p> The accessories tab includes a PDF viewer and a calculator, as well as a text editor and an SD card copier. You also have a basic web browser—plenty of tools to get you started.</p><h2 id="Audio-Bluetooth-connectivity"><a href="#Audio-Bluetooth-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Bluetooth connectivity"></a>Audio: Bluetooth connectivity</h2><p> You won’t find built-in speakers, but the Pi 400 will play audio on your monitor’s speakers when you use the HDMI to mini HDMI cable included in the kit. It also has Bluetooth for connecting a pair of wireless headphones. I had no problem connecting a few different types of Bluetooth headphones to the Pi. There’s no audio output jack, but you can connect compatible USB speakers if you launch the appropriate USB commands in the terminal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vAb_0QFg4Uze6uuiSMlTPtkw_CA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Raspberry-Pi-400-Mini-PC-5-b326f92abc1a4349910f0b7b5d0e2d53.jpg"                      alt="Raspberry Pi 400"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139107/17108" target="_top" id="2139107">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139107" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139107/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Erika Rawes &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Network-Ethernet-or-dual-band-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Network-Ethernet-or-dual-band-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Network: Ethernet or dual-band Wi-Fi"></a>Network: Ethernet or dual-band Wi-Fi</h2><p> The Pi 400 has dual-band Wi-Fi, so you can connect it to a 2.4GHz or 5GHz network.

Also, keep in mind when using a USB webcam, you have to go into the terminal and enter a command to install the webcam package. You can then use commands to take a picture with your webcam, and you can adjust your commands to specify things like sizing, borders, and other conditions. It’s not as seamless as a typical Windows or Chromebox mini PC, where you can just plug, play, and start video chatting. You have to enter a command for just about everything you do.</p><p> Pi computers are great for makers, but once I really started experimenting with the Pi 400, I realized the keyboard is beneficial in some areas, but it’s limiting in others.</p><h2 id="Software-Learn-to-code"><a href="#Software-Learn-to-code" class="headerlink" title="Software: Learn to code"></a>Software: Learn to code</h2><p> In addition to a basic office suite, photo processing software, and games, the Pi 400 Kit comes with several coding applications like Scratch, Scratch 2, Scratch 3, Blue Jay Java IDE, Green Foot Java IDE, Geany, Mathematica, Sense HAT Emulator, and more.</p><p> Although the Raspberry Pi OS is basic, the included applications make this an ideal computer for a beginner who wants to learn basic computer programming skills. The interface includes a direct connection to the Pi site, where you can find numerous project ideas from 3D print templates to robotics projects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-An-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-An-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An amazing value"></a>Price: An amazing value</h2><p> Unless you’re well-versed in using a Pi, I would not suggest going with the Pi 400 alone.

The Arduino Kit is more like the older Pi models in that it’s tiny, and designed for building different types of projects.</p><p> The Pi 400 Kit is designed for projects too, but its PC-in-a-keyboard design and included software makes it a better option as a personal computer. The Arduino Uno is even more bare-bones than the Pi 400 with the Raspberry Pi OS installed, as the Pi 400 kit includes quite a few office and programming applications.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mini-pcs-4047271" >The Best Home Theater PCs of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Practical, versatile, and affordable.</strong></p><p> Unlike previous Raspberry Pis that are for more advanced users, the Pi 400 kit is designed for everyone.

href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/easyscreen-videotaker-analysis-plus-other-apps-for-2024/" >how do you choose the right one <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? The answer depends, of course, on what you’re actually looking for. Most robot vacuums do the same thing—clean up dirt and other small debris while navigating around your home. However, some robot vacuums have additional features such as automatically going back to the charging dock and running on a set schedule, or even mopping the floor as well as vacuuming.</p><p> Since robot vacuums are designed to help keep your home clean, you should prioritize how well they clean first and foremost. A good robot vacuum needs to navigate your home while cleaning up dirt and debris easily. It shouldn’t constantly get stuck against an object that prevents it from cleaning. Robot vacuums do get stuck at times, but it shouldn’t happen often and a good one will learn where corners and objects are.</p><p> Your robot vacuum should be able to move from room to room, even if the flooring isn’t completely level around the home. You’ll also want a vacuum that won’t break itself, as in it won’t fall down a flight of stairs. These aren’t cheap, so you don’t want a vacuum that will break itself within a few months.</p><p> What prevents a robot vac from taking a damaging tumble requires smart sensors, which will help it to navigate around objects and furniture. All of our recommendations will have these smart sensors built-in, so no matter what you pick, you can take comfort in the fact that it won’t get stuck or fall onto a step and break itself.</p><p> With all this in mind, let’s take a closer look at some of the best robot vacuums around. Keep in mind that all our picks do an exceptionally great job of cleaning!</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>8</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It boasts 6000Pa of suction, which is powerful enough to catch dirt, dust, pet hair, food crumbs, and other debris. There is also LiDAR navigation with 3D obstacle avoidance to map your house and get around any household item that may get in its way during the cleanup. </p><p> More importantly, the S8 Pro Ultra has a self-cleaning dock, which can wash and dry the mop during and after the cleanup, empty the dust and dirt from the vacuum, and refill the water. You can pretty much automate your cleaning routine and enjoy sparkling floors every day. </p><p> While mopping hasn’t always been a strong suit of robot vacuums, the VibraRise 2.0 Mopping System included in the S8 Pro Ultra works wonderfully and delivers some of the best mopping you will get in a robot vacuum. That said, as it can only lift the mop pad 5mm off the ground, it can’t always clear relatively high-pile carpets. So, if you want to avoid your expensive carpets getting damp or wet, it’s best to use the “avoid carpets” function. </p><p> The companion smartphone app is easy to use and offers various customization options to control how the robot vacuum does its cleaning. You will also be happy to know that the company releases frequent firmware updates for the robot vacuum to iron out any kinks that have been widely reported. </p><p> As you can expect, given its expansive list of capabilities and features, the S8 Pro Ultra costs a pretty penny. But this premium robot vacuum is worth the price tag. But it’s not perfect. It lacks a built-in camera for remote home monitoring like some of the other similarly-priced robot vacuums. You also can’t remove its mop pad, and the dock is quite bulky. </p><p> If the S8 Pro Ultra is out of your budget, you can consider <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Auto-Drying-Self-Refilling-Self-Emptying-Avoidance/dp/B0BVVSTJWS/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208961&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/749819/best-robot-vacuum/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Roborock’s Q Revo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which <a class="link"   href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/in-2024-accelerating-video-success-on-youtube-for-100kplus-views/" >offers many similar features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but, expectedly, doesn’t offer the same level of performance as the S8 Pro Ultra. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/roborock-s8-pro-ultra.png"                      alt="Roborock S8 Pro Ultra"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Robot Vacuum Overall</p><h5 id="Roborock-S8-Pro-Ultra-1"><a href="#Roborock-S8-Pro-Ultra-1" class="headerlink" title="Roborock S8 Pro Ultra"></a>Roborock S8 Pro Ultra</h5><p>The Roborock S8 Pro Ultra is a premium robot vacuum cum mop that delivers outstanding performance and a hands-free cleaning experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR5CGY21/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208961&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/749819/best-robot-vacuum/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://roborock.pxf.io/c/156932/1179705/14848?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU208961&subId2=ehtg&u=https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-pro-ultra/" >See at roborock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/roborock-s8-pro-ultra-wht-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-rockdock-ultra-dock-white/6540937.p" >See at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Budget-Robot-Vacuum-eufy-BoostIQ-RoboVac-11S-Max"><a href="#Best-Budget-Robot-Vacuum-eufy-BoostIQ-RoboVac-11S-Max" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Robot Vacuum: eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max"></a>Best Budget Robot Vacuum: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Super-Thin-Super-Strong-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile/dp/B07R295MLS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208961&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/749819/best-robot-vacuum/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/eufy-boostiq-robovac-11s-max.jpg"                      alt="Eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max"                > </p><p>eufy</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Slim design</td><td>No maps or LiDAR navigation</td></tr><tr><td>Good vacuum performance</td><td>No included mop</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to use</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Affordable</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> While the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Super-Thin-Super-Strong-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile/dp/B07R295MLS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208961&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/749819/best-robot-vacuum/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t exactly a cheap robot vacuum, it’s affordable and offers good value for money. The eufy offering is also ultra-simple and perfect for anyone who doesn’t want to fiddle around with apps and settings. Plus, its slimmer profile helps it reach under couches and beds without trouble. </p><p> The 11S Max has a reasonable 2000Pa suction, and it does a good job on bare floors and efficiently picks up dirt and debris. You will also be happy to know that the built-in dust bin is big enough for a couple of rounds before you need to empty it. </p><p> Instead of a more sophisticated LiDAR system, the RoboVac 11S Max uses infrared sensors to navigate around your home as a part of bounce navigation. This isn’t very efficient, but it is enough to get the job done. Additionally, in place of a smartphone app, you get a remote to control the vacuum and set the cleaning mode and other options. </p><p> In other highlights, the eufy robot vacuum doesn’t require network connectivity. So, getting it up and running is as simple as plugging the charging dock, charging it, and using the remote to start a cleaning session. It can run for about 100 minutes on a single charge. </p><p> Sure, it’s far from the smartest or most feature-rich robot vacuum on the market. But if you want an affordable, no-frills cleaner for your home, the eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max is a good option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/eufy-boostiq-robovac-11s-max.png"                      alt="Eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Budget Robot Vacuum</p><h5 id="eufy-BoostIQ-RoboVac-11S-MAX-1"><a href="#eufy-BoostIQ-RoboVac-11S-MAX-1" class="headerlink" title="eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S MAX"></a>eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S MAX</h5><p>eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max is a good choice for basic automated cleaning.

The companion app is also easy to use and gives you plenty of control over how the X8 Pro cleans different rooms. </p><p> All in all, it’s an easy recommendation for pet owners.

It’s an all-around solid offering that looks different from the typical circular robot vacuums with its D-shaped design. Besides giving it an interesting look, the design is helpful in X2 Omni cleaning corners and edges.</p><p> It also boasts an impressive 8,000Pa suction to drag in all the dirt, dust, hair, and other debris from your floors. Additionally, you get spinning mop pads that do an excellent job of mopping. But while the X2 Omni can lift up the mop pads to avoid carpets when it detects them, it isn’t always able to <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/ecovacs-deebot-x2-omni" >clear carpets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p> Another highlight of the X2 Omni is its self-cleaning ability. Besides transferring the contents of its internal dust bin to the dock, it can also clean the mop pads, dry them with hot air, and fill in the water for the next round of mopping. So you essentially get autonomous cleaning, at least until you need to clear out the dock’s dust bag and fill in the water. </p><p> There is also a camera on-board, which, apart from helping the vacuum navigate, can be used to watch your home on your phone or have two-way calls. </p><p> As you can expect, all these helpful features add up, and the Ecovas Deebot X2 Omni is expensive.

To add Cellular, pricing starts at $499.

After a few bike rides where my average speed was skewed because I forgot to pause or unpause the workout during or after a break, I was pleased to find that you can enable automatic pausing (auto-pause) for biking and running.</p><p> In my experience, the watch was quick to pause when I stopped at traffic lights and resume once I started moving again. (This is also helpful if you forget to end a workout.)</p><h2 id="Who-Should-Buy-It"><a href="#Who-Should-Buy-It" class="headerlink" title="Who Should Buy It?"></a>Who Should Buy It?</h2><p> If you have a Series 6 or older, it’s worth moving up to the Series 9 as you’re likely dealing with declining performance and a more easily depleted battery. The Series 9 costs the same as the Series 7 and 8, so there’s little reason to purchase last year’s model.</p><p> You can use your old watch bands and cases on a newer model, which is convenient.</p><p> On the other hand, if you have an Apple Watch Series 7 or later that works well and has a good battery, there’s little reason to upgrade. (The Series 4 and newer watches are eligible for watchOS 10 if you have an iPhone XS or more recent.)</p><p> One thing to know is that if you get an Apple Watch, you should have an iPhone too. It doesn’t play well with Android smartphones and won’t pair over Bluetooth.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-vs-fitbit-8650200" >I Tried Both: Apple Watch Series 9 vs Fitbit Charge 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-apple-watch-4584460" >Smart Watches &amp; Wearables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Watch Series 9 GPS + Cellular 45mm</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Case Options  45mm and 41mm aluminum or stainless steel</li><li>Battery Life  Up to 18 hours (36 in Low Power Mode)</li><li>Processor  Apple S9</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-android-tutorial-reversed-video-display/"><u>[New] Android Tutorial Reversed Video Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-engaging-audiences-making-popular-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] Engaging Audiences Making Popular YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-the-essentials-a-comprehensive-guide-to-telegram-web-usage/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering the Essentials A Comprehensive Guide to Telegram Web Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quietude-on-the-silver-screen-a-study/"><u>2024 Approved Quietude on the Silver Screen A Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/halt-predicted-posts-no-more-suggests-on-insta/"><u>Halt Predicted Posts No More Suggests on Insta</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-apple-iphone-12-lock-screen-3-foolproof-methods-that-actually-work-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Apple iPhone 12 Lock Screen 3 Foolproof Methods that Actually Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/swagboard-t1-by-swagtron-a-fast-ride-with-a-hefty-tag/"><u>Swagboard T1 by Swagtron - A Fast Ride with a Hefty Tag</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/tcl-32s325-32-inch-720p-roku-smart-led-tv-2019-review/"><u>TCL 32S325 32-Inch 720P Roku Smart LED TV (2019) Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-5-key-questions-every-prospective-customer-should-ask-about-fitness-trackers/"><u>The 5 Key Questions Every Prospective Customer Should Ask About Fitness Trackers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-acer-aspire-c27-unpacked-an-impressive-all-in-one-computer-with-discreet-design-comprehensive-capabilities/"><u>The Acer Aspire C27 Unpacked: An Impressive All-in-One Computer with Discreet Design, Comprehensive Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/toms-tech-hub-expert-insights-on-latest-hardware/"><u>Tom's Tech Hub: Expert Insights on Latest Hardware</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/universal-unlock-pattern-for-nubia-by-drfone-android/"><u>Universal Unlock Pattern for Nubia</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/xcom-2-not-starting-troubleshooting-guide-for-windows-users/"><u>XCOM 2 Not Starting: Troubleshooting Guide for Windows Users</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> Generous cutouts allow for easy access to all ports, and vents on the bottom of the case help to maintain airflow and keep your computer from overheating. Fintie offers a number of color and style options, from the Vintage Leather look that we tested to playful graphic prints and sleek solid colors.</p><p> It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> The synthetic leather provides a comfortable grip, and that meant a great deal to us when we were assessing the overall utility of the case. It’s comfortable to walk around with it in your hands, and there’s enough traction in the synthetic leather to keep it from slipping in most cases. The Fintie also offers a host of other color and style options to allow for a little customization.</p><p> One more plus? Contrary to some other options, this case is easy to put on and take off, fitting much like a second skin. It is loose enough to remove without a hassle and tight enough to effectively protect your computer.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re interested in moving more and monitoring daily activities with the help of a chic fitness-tracking watch, the Garmin Vivomove HR is worth a closer look. The is an accessory aimed at those who like to be active and stylish too. I wore and used this watch for over a week and was impressed with the look of it, level of wellness data captured, and the overall support it offers for general well-being.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/I4tLxDp9_npPph8lgb8sOWODnd4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivomove-HR-Fitness-Tracker-Watch-3-c8e32586b7d840a0a2c9747a6255b802.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivomove HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-polished-regular-watch"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-polished-regular-watch" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a polished regular watch"></a><strong>Design: Looks like a polished regular watch</strong></h2><p> Some people enjoy the sporty design of an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-models-4175232" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Samsung smartwatch. But if you feel like you’re compromising utility over personal style with those options, the Garmin Vivomove HR offers a happy middle ground.</p><p> The watch I tested was fitted with a brown leather band and gold stainless steel case. If you were to glance at it, you wouldn’t be able to tell that there’s a lot going on underneath the surface. With a simple turn of the wrist the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , placed discreetly in the bottom center of the watch face, illuminates for at-a-glance access to step count and other data. The watch hands also conveniently move out of the way for better visibility and return to reflect the current time when not in use.</p><p> The overall size of the Vivomove HR is 43 x 43 x 11.6 millimeters (HWD) and the display measures 0.38 x 0.76 inches. On larger wrists, this won’t be a big deal, but smaller wrists like mine could face a fit challenge since the face is on the larger side. But the device as a whole only weighs 56.5 grams, which won’t weigh you down. It also comes with a 5 ATM water-resistance rating, which means you’re good to use this for lap swimming and other water sports, and won’t need to worry about rain and snow exposure. I wore this watch in the shower and when washing dishes and found it to be effective against repelling water and always dried quickly.</p><p> In terms of design quirks, in lieu of a typical micro USB charging cord, this watch features a charging clip with a USB connection. The clip opens easily and must be placed directly onto the charging contacts on the back of the watch face in order to charge&#x2F;transfer data. This charging method is a bit of a quirk of some Garmin watches, but it eliminates the need for charging ports that could be at risk when exposed to moisture.</p><h2 id="Setup-Fast-pairing-with-Garmin-Connect"><a href="#Setup-Fast-pairing-with-Garmin-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Fast pairing with Garmin Connect"></a><strong>Setup: Fast pairing with Garmin Connect</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Garmin Vivomove HR is easy through the Garmin Connect app. I already had the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> downloaded on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pick-best-iphone-for-you-1999293" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which made the fast setup process speedier. The app immediately detected the Vivomove HR and then presented on-screen instructions for calibrating the watch hands, setting the wrist placement (right or left), widget preferences, and touring basic functions. This took a matter of minutes since the Garmin Vivomove HR was nearly fully charged out of the box.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Comfortable-for-all-day-wear-but-the-screen-can-be-finicky"><a href="#Comfort-Comfortable-for-all-day-wear-but-the-screen-can-be-finicky" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Comfortable for all-day wear, but the screen can be finicky"></a><strong>Comfort: Comfortable for all-day wear, but the screen can be finicky</strong></h2><p> I wore the Garmin Vivomove HR during waking and sleeping hours and never experienced discomfort while I slept. If I did experience any issues, it was during the day when conducting routine tasks—especially typing. Invariably the watch would shift and the larger face made contact with my wristbone.</p><p> The wellness data, especially with consistent daily wear, was helpful and motivated me to move more.</p><p> During sleeping hours, though, I wasn’t disturbed by any shifting of the timepiece. And since sleep mode is on by default, I wasn’t bothered by notifications or the screen illuminating. When trying to fall asleep or during waking moments, I was occasionally startled by the green light from the heart-rate sensor on the back of the watch face. If you get a tight fit against your wrist, this shouldn’t be an issue.</p><p> In terms of overall ease of use, the only actions you’ll need to master are touching and swiping the screen: there are no buttons or bezels to deal with. Touch prompts sound like a no-brainer and an appealing way to interact with the watch, but I found the screen to be fussy and slow to respond at times. If I didn’t tap the screen in just the right way, I had to repeatedly tap until I could stop or start a workout timer. And if I failed to complete a full sweeping motion through the widgets, the screen wouldn’t advance to the next item. Instead I ended up just drilling down further into that particular category.</p><p> For example, if I didn’t fully swipe past the weather widget information for the day, the screen would take me to the weekly forecast. Then I had to press the back button to get to the general widgets screen. With continued use, I became savvier with touch and swiping actions, but it was still a consistent issue when trying to start&#x2F;stop workout timers. This was an even bigger issue outside and in bright sunlight, which made the screen virtually undetectable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-A-cheerleader-for-wellness-rather-than-training"><a href="#Performance-A-cheerleader-for-wellness-rather-than-training" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A cheerleader for wellness rather than training"></a><strong>Performance: A cheerleader for wellness rather than training</strong></h2><p> The Vivomove HR is a well-rounded device. Not only does it look fashionable as an everyday accessory, but it also offers stopwatch functions, monitors heart rate (resting and active), automatically tracks activities such as running, walking, and even using an elliptical machine, and tracks steps, calories, and other fitness data such as VO2 max.</p><p> The wellness data, especially with consistent daily wear, was helpful and motivated me to move more. The Move Bar, while annoying, ultimately encouraged me to avoid prolonged periods of sitting or standing by simply reminding me to move if I hadn’t been very active in the last hour. But when it comes to accuracy as a fitness tracker, I wasn’t wildly impressed.</p><p> On a few short 1 to 3-mile runs, the Vivomove HR recorded my speed as up to 1 minute faster than my Garmin Forerunner 35 running watch. Heart rate was also considerably more elevated according to the Vivomove. And when I launched a strength training activity, the counter was always behind by about five reps. The Move IQ technology that auto-detects workouts didn’t always get it right either. Frequently when I was walking, the watch logged that stretch of movement as a running or an elliptical machine session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VpHve66CRb4yVumQ8GVo-3vNLGQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivomove-HR-Fitness-Tracker-Watch-2-240036104f704a2d8c8f8425f075709b.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivomove HR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144285/7443" target="_top" id="2144285">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144285" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144285/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-Key-Features-Options-options-options"><a href="#Software-Key-Features-Options-options-options" class="headerlink" title="Software&#x2F;Key Features: Options, options, options"></a><strong>Software&#x2F;Key Features: Options, options, options</strong></h2><p> Fortunately, saving workout information and viewing any activity from the watch is easy and foolproof through the Garmin Connect app. If you prefer to set this watch up and sync data using your computer, the Garmin Express software allows you to complete the same steps for setting up and configuring the device along with syncing data with your Garmin Connect account and checking for software updates.</p><p> It’s entirely possible to choose between either setup, despite the quick-start instructions that indicate everything should be done through the mobile app. But using the app alone and syncing regularly helps send automatic software updates directly to the device when not in use. At any point you can log in to the Garmin Connect web app, regardless of which way you decide to sync data, to view your information on a larger display and download it.</p><p> The key features of the software revolve around basic activity tracking from climbing flights of stairs to monitoring all-day stress levels (based on heart rate) to breaking down hours of deep versus light sleep. While this is information you can glance at on your watch, the app distills all of this general wellness into daily, weekly, and monthly reports.</p><p> There’s also plenty of customization power when it comes to organizing the activity tracking data you see on your watch display and in the app itself. You can choose the widgets displayed such as music controls to control music on your smartphone and the number of intensity workout minutes you’ve reached for the week. And if you prefer to shuffle the way that data is arranged in the mobile app, there’s a simple drag and drop feature that helps you do that.</p><p> This complementary software also places the control in your hands when it comes to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-social-media-explaining-the-big-trend-3486616" >social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sharing and integrating with outside fitness-tracking platforms such as Map My Run and Strava—which you can easily do from the Garmin Connect mobile and web apps.</p><p> In terms of design quirks, in lieu of a typical micro USB charging cord, this watch features a charging clip with a USB connection.</p><h2 id="Battery-Solid-performance-for-five-days"><a href="#Battery-Solid-performance-for-five-days" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Solid performance for five days"></a><strong>Battery: Solid performance for five days</strong></h2><p> Garmin says that this watch can last for over two weeks in watch mode and up to five days in smartwatch mode—which I can confirm. This claim tracked even with frequent glancing at the display and toggling through the widgets as well as receiving regular text and email updates throughout the day. I didn’t see the battery drain in any consistent way until the fifth day. And recharging the watch was fast: it took about only one hour.</p><h2 id="Price-Expensive-but-it-has-a-touchscreen"><a href="#Price-Expensive-but-it-has-a-touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Price: Expensive, but it has a touchscreen"></a><strong>Price: Expensive, but it has a touchscreen</strong></h2><p> The Garmin Vivomove HR ranges in price from around $200 for the Sport version that comes with a silicone band to $350 for Premium leather-band alternatives. There are certainly cheaper hybrid smartwatch options on the market. Both the Withings Move Steel HR and Fossil Smartwatch HR Collider retail for less than $200. And while they offer similar features such as message previews, heart rate, weather and sleep data, and even GPS, neither offers a touchscreen display and unique health data like stress level readings based on heart rate patterns.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1265663">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1265663">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmartinic.evyy.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1265663%2F4482'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1265663/4482"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Garmin-Vivomove-HR-vs-Withings-Move-Steel-HR"><a href="#Garmin-Vivomove-HR-vs-Withings-Move-Steel-HR" class="headerlink" title="Garmin Vivomove HR vs. Withings Move Steel HR"></a><strong>Garmin Vivomove HR vs. Withings Move Steel HR</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move Steel HR ($180 MSRP) also occupies a similar space. It matches the Vivomove HR by offering optical wrist-based heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, water-resistance up to 50 meters, and smartphone notifications. The Withings Move Steel HR also has a stylish analog watch look, but if you prefer a flat over curved face and a touchscreen you can interact with, the Vivomove HR takes the prize. Heart-rate tracking inconsistencies plague both watches, but the Withings does come with connected GPS compatibility.</p><p> While this is a boon for distance tracking during workouts, the downside is that you’ll need to have your smartphone with you. The Withings Move Steel HR battery longevity is supposed to be 25 days and an additional month without smart mode turned off. But if you prefer the touchscreen interaction rather than the dual displays—one dial that monitors step count progress by percentage and one LCD that displays notifications—the Vivomove could be worth the extra money.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A quality hybrid watch that’s best for general wellness tracking and basic smart features.</strong></p><p> The Garmin Vivomove HR isn’t the watch to reach for when you want to accurately log running or cycling workouts, but if you want a larger bird’s-eye view of your wellness, this is worth considering. It’s stylish enough for work and everyday wear and possesses thoughtful design details and health tracking features other hybrid smartwatch competitors don’t.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Vivomove HR</li><li>Product Brand  Garmin</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  August 2017</li><li>Color  Gold</li><li>Platform  Garmin OS</li><li>Battery capacity  Up to 5 days in smartwatch mode</li><li>Water resistance  5 ATM</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-express-originality-craft-professional-logos-from-template-designs-free-for-2024/"><u>[New] Express Originality Craft Professional Logos From Template Designs (Free) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-instagram-success-stories-leveraging-highlights-for-growth/"><u>[New] In 2024, Instagram Success Stories Leveraging Highlights for Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-vloggers-verdict-youtube-vs-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Vlogger's Verdict Youtube Vs.

class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in a Gaming Chair in 2023"></a>What to Look for in a Gaming Chair in 2023</h2><p> Gaming chairs and <a class="link"   href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-peeling-back-layers-the-hidden-meanings-of-everyday-emojis/" >office chairs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have a lot in common when it comes to finding a good one. In both cases, you want a chair that’s comfortable to sit in for extended periods of time. You should be ending your gaming session because you’re done playing, not because your body hurts too much to keep going.</p><p> This means ergonomics are at the top of the list of features. A properly curved back, adjustable armrests, neck and lower-back support, and anything that promotes good posture and comfort are bonuses.</p><p> It’s also vitally important to get a chair rated for your weight and height. Any ergonomic features won’t work correctly if the chair is mismatched to your physical frame, making you extremely uncomfortable—not to mention that the chair may break.</p><p> Durability and choice of materials are important, as well. A full steel frame leather chair will be more expensive, but you won’t have to replace it as quickly. Then again, modern synthetic materials might breathe better, while materials like leather will typically retain heat. Keep the temperature and humidity of your gaming space in mind when deciding on chair materials.</p><p> Finally, the styling of the chair is much more important when it comes to gaming chairs than regular office chairs. The truth is that a good office chair works perfectly fine as a gaming chair—and, for many people, the “gaming aesthetic” isn’t appealing or something they want to advertise.</p><p> However, if you feel like wearing your gamer badge loud and proud, picking a chair with the nicest design for your setup is just as important as functionality. At the end of the day, the space is for you, after all. Picking a chair that looks good is just as important as how comfortable it is!</p><p> Now, let’s get into our best gaming chair recommendations.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>5</td><td>60</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

As you might imagine, this means their chairs are more expensive than the average gaming chair, but not so expensive that they’re difficult to afford.</p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://secretlab.co/products/titan-evo-2022-series" >Titan Evo 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the culmination of that philosophy, refined over the years into a chair that does exactly what it needs to perfectly, without adding features no one cares about.</p><p> This gaming chair is built like a tank, is designed from the ground up to provide the best gaming ergonomics, and uses an elegant magnetic attachment system to add or remove the bundled head pillow.</p><p> The customization options on offer are what elevate the Titan Evo to the top of the pack. The chair is offered in three sizes to get the perfect fit, and then you can choose your own upholstery materials, colors, and even designs based on gaming or pop-culture properties.</p><p> A fully customized Titan Evo can inflate the price significantly, but that’s the cost of getting exactly the chair you want. If the price is too shocking, you can still opt for one of the more standard models.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/titan-evo-product-image-1.png"                      alt="titan-evo-product-image-1"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Gaming Chair Overall</p><h5 id="Secretlab-Titan-EVO-2022-Series-1"><a href="#Secretlab-Titan-EVO-2022-Series-1" class="headerlink" title="Secretlab Titan EVO 2022 Series"></a>Secretlab Titan EVO 2022 Series</h5><p>The Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 Series is the ultimate chair for 99% of gamers.

And while the market is a bit limited, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Bluetooth-Speakers-Ergonomic/dp/B07QGY4VGK/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206498&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/793520/best-gaming-chair/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stands out due to its affordable price and impressive adjustability.</p><p> Designed around a sturdy metal frame, this GTRacing chair can recline 155 degrees, has a removable headrest and lumbar cushion, supports 300 lbs, and is wrapped in durable carbon fiber leather. Its overall style is a bit underwhelming—it looks like every other gaming chair on the market—although the built-in footrest helps differentiate it from the competition. You’ll also find built-in speakers positioned behind your shoulders, a unique feature that makes it easy to pump out music or immerse yourself in your game.</p><p> Tall users might find the footrest uncomfortable, as it’ll serve more as a “calf rest” than a true footrest. Most people will find the footrest entirely adequate, but anyone with long legs might think it’s awkward to have so much of their legs dangling off the end of the chair.</p><p> Look past that minor caveat, and you’ll be treated to a reasonably priced gaming chair that should serve you well whether you’re nodding off to sleep or relaxing with your favorite game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gtracing-gaming-chair.png"                      alt="gtracing gaming chair"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137220/26400" target="_top" id="2137220">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137220" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137220/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Gaming Chair with Footrest</p><h5 id="GTRacing-Gaming-Chair-with-Footrest-1"><a href="#GTRacing-Gaming-Chair-with-Footrest-1" class="headerlink" title="GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest"></a>GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest</h5><p>$130 $200 Save $70 </p><p>It looks like a generic gaming chair, but its reasonable price, solid construction, and retractable footrest make the GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest a great choice for gamers who want to lounge out at their desk.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Bluetooth-Speakers-Ergonomic/dp/B07QGY4VGK/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206498&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/793520/best-gaming-chair/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$130 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Gaming-Recliner-RESPAWN-RSP-900"><a href="#Best-Gaming-Recliner-RESPAWN-RSP-900" class="headerlink" title="Best Gaming Recliner: RESPAWN RSP-900"></a>Best Gaming Recliner: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/RESPAWN-900-Racing-Gaming-Recliner-Reclining/dp/B07RKYD5YH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206498&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/793520/best-gaming-chair/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >RESPAWN RSP-900 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/RESPAWN-900-Racing-Gaming-Recliner-Reclining/dp/B07RKYD5YH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206498&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/793520/best-gaming-chair/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RESPAWN-900-Racing-Gaming-Recliner-Reclining/dp/B07RKYD5YH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206498&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/793520/best-gaming-chair/&asc_campaign=Commerce"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/respawn-recliner.jpg"                      alt="Respawn recliner in living room"                > Respawn</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none;

The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/RESPAWN-900-Racing-Gaming-Recliner-Reclining/dp/B07RKYD5YH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206498&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/793520/best-gaming-chair/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Respawn RSP-900 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> maintains the gaming chair aesthetic while offering the comforts of a recliner. It’s perfect for console gamers with dedicated gaming spaces looking for a comfortable, gaming-styled chair.</p><p> We say ‘console gamers’ since recliners like these aren’t suited to playing at a desk with a mouse and keyboard. If you have you have <a class="link"   href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-nubia-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/" >a lap desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your keyboard and mouse and have your PC hooked up to a TV, then you can take full advantage of the RSP-900.</p><p> Another issue is that this recliner doesn’t have a height-adjustable seat, which is normal for a recliner, but not great for a desk chair. It’s built to sit back and relax, and many features you’d see in a typical office chair aren’t present.</p><p> The backrest and footrest recline independently, so you can find the combination of angles that work best for you. We also especially like the inclusion of a pouch and cupholder, so you can access your phone or remote without getting up or needing a side table.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/respawn-gaming-recliner.png"                      alt="respawn gaming recliner"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Gaming Recliner</p><h5 id="Respawn-RSP-900-1"><a href="#Respawn-RSP-900-1" class="headerlink" title="Respawn RSP-900"></a>Respawn RSP-900</h5><p>$291 $320 Save $29 </p><p>While it may be more budget-oriented, the RSP-900 looks great and offers fantastic features that will elevate any gaming room.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/RESPAWN-900-Racing-Gaming-Recliner-Reclining/dp/B07RKYD5YH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206498&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/793520/best-gaming-chair/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$291 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="What’s-the-difference-between-a-gaming-chair-and-an-office-chair"><a href="#What’s-the-difference-between-a-gaming-chair-and-an-office-chair" class="headerlink" title="What’s the difference between a gaming chair and an office chair?"></a>What’s the difference between a gaming chair and an office chair?</h3><p> Gaming chairs and office chairs come in all shapes and sizes, so there is considerable overlap between the two.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111965/7443" target="_top" id="2111965">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111965" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111965/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-stream-and-save-a-guide-to-xbox-broadcasting/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Stream and Save A Guide to Xbox Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-discover-times-tales-top-10-historical-channels-to-study-with/"><u>[Updated] Discover Time's Tales Top 10 Historical Channels to Study With</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-initiate-your-own-blog-product-analysis-edition/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Initiate Your Own Blog Product Analysis Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-tech-manual-for-saving-web-streamed-television/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Tech Manual for Saving Web-Streamed Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-odd-angle-intrigue-of-instagram-video-postings/"><u>2024 Approved The Odd-Angle Intrigue of Instagram Video Postings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/battlefield-your-simple-2024-fix-for-the-wont-launch-problem/"><u>Battlefield ^: Your Simple 2024 Fix for the Won't Launch Problem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ng-likes-and-loads-jake-pauls-youtube-ambition-for-2024/"><u>Chasing Likes and Loads Jake Paul's YouTube Ambition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-assessment-why-nintendos-switch-is-top-tier-portable-playtime/"><u>Comprehensive Assessment: Why Nintendo's Switch Is Top-Tier Portable Playtime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/elevate-your-profile-a-closer-look-at-linkedin-premium-benefits/"><u>Elevate Your Profile: A Closer Look at LinkedIn Premium Benefits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-use-google-assistant-on-your-lock-screen-of-asus-rog-phone-7-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Use Google Assistant on Your Lock Screen Of Asus ROG Phone 7 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-comparison-chromecast-against-roku-for-ultimate-viewing/"><u>In-Depth Comparison: Chromecast Against Roku for Ultimate Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-missing-features-in-samsung-galaxy-tab-a-2er-2020-review/"><u>In-Depth Look at Missing Features in Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2Er 2020 Review)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/the-best-value-in-athletic-timepieces-our-in-depth-fossil-sports-review/"><u>The Best Value in Athletic Timepieces: Our In-Depth Fossil Sports Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-your-microsoft-docks-connectivity-with-windows-ebox-11-expert-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Troubleshooting Your Microsoft Dock's Connectivity with Windows Ebox 11 - Expert Tips & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-choice-professionals-guide-to-dji-mavic-e-2-pro-camera-drone/"><u>Unveiling the Best Choice: Professional's Guide to DJI Mavic E 2 Pro Camera Drone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/zoom-your-way-to-affordable-photos-the-kodak-fz53-review/"><u>Zoom Your Way to Affordable Photos: The Kodak FZ53 Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-an-eReader-in-2024"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-an-eReader-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in an eReader in 2024"></a>What to Look for in an eReader in 2024</h2><p> If you want to buy an eReader, you’re probably looking to read more. Of course, you can read books on your tablet or phone, but you’ll want a dedicated eReader if you want to enjoy a good book without distractions, as eReaders generally can’t do much else.</p><p> eReaders make picking up a book and reading a lot easier, as you’ll have a whole collection of novels at your fingertips. However, if you want to bring your existing eBook selection to your new purchase, you must keep file compatibility in mind.</p><p> There are multiple eBook file formats, including <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-instagram-video-to-mp3-everything-you-need-to-know/" >EPUB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-chuckle-chest-selecting-15-hilarious-video-treasures-for-your-viewing-pleasure/" >MOBI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, CBR, and the more familiar formats like PDFs. Most eReaders can read most of the file formats, but there are important exceptions to remember. For example, Kindles (the most popular eReader line) cannot natively read EPUB files—at least <a class="link"   href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-bringing-imagery-elements-into-harmony/" >not yet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. They also cannot read CBR or CBZ files, common file types for electronic comic books.</p><p> On the flip side, Kobo eReaders (a Kindle competitor) cannot read Amazon’s proprietary eBook formats, MOBI and <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-elevate-your-videos-visibility-with-perfect-thumbnail-sizing-for-2024/" >AZW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> The good news is that with a third-party app like <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-comprehensive-guide-to-facebooks-full-screen-feature/" >Calibre <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can convert any files you have to another eBook file type and load them into the eReader you choose without issues. Also, if you’re new to eReaders or are not bringing your collection over, simply buying books from your eReader’s store (like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b?ie=UTF8&node=133140011&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Kindle Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/" >your local library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be more than sufficient.</p><p> Another thing to keep in mind with eReaders is their <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamline-your-content-with-these-4-instagram-looping-hacks/" >E Ink technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-the-key-to-captivating-audiences-crafting-fb-slideshows/" >E Ink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> replicates the look of paper in electronic form, which provides several benefits over a regular LED tablet. Aside from dramatically increased battery life, the biggest benefit is the lack of glare, which makes reading outside much easier. An eReader’s light tends to be less bright, making for more comfortable dark room reading.</p><p> Due to E Ink, eReaders also have a great battery life, with battery lives of weeks with light use (or days if you’re a heavy reader).

This 6-8-inch E Ink eReader is easy to slip into any bag, and you can pull it out and enjoy glare-free reading anytime, anywhere. The 300 pixels per inch (PPI) upgrade makes your text look great.</p><p> In addition, the 2021 Paperwhite is <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >waterproof <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, ensuring you won’t damage it while reading poolside or at the beach. It’s the perfect companion for any vacation day. Amazon has also finally upgraded this new Kindle to charge via <a class="link"   href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so there’s no need to carry extra cables for the eReader.</p><p> You’ll also get access to all the books on the extensive Kindle store without worrying about eBook compatibility. You can still add files to your Kindle, <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/" >check out eBooks from your local public library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and load them up if you want. Finally, with Audible, it’s easy to go from reading to listening and back again.</p><p> If you have EPUB book files, you’ll need to use a program like <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-comprehensive-guide-to-facebooks-full-screen-feature/" >Calibre <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to transfer them over to your Kindle as the file type isn’t compatible out of the box, but otherwise, you can load MOBI files, PDFs, and other popular formats right onto the Kindle with minimal fuss.</p><p> The Paperwhite Signature Edition is only available in the 32GB model, although there’s still an <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-16-GB-adjustable/dp/B095J2XYWX/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >16GB Paperwhite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While 32GB may not seem like much storage if you’re used to storage options from tablets or phones, in reality eBooks don’t take up much space.</p><p> The main downside to the 2021 Paperwhite is a problem with many of Amazon’s tech products. Amazon does put ads in their Kindle line, which can be frustrating for some users. These ads are restricted to the lock screen and a small bar at the bottom of the home page, so they will never interrupt your reading experience. However, if you don’t want ads, you’ll have to pay an extra $20 or see if an Amazon customer service representative will remove them.</p><p> But if ads aren’t a sticking point, the Kindle Signature Edition is the best eReader for almost everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition.png"                      alt="amazon kindle paperwhite signature edition"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best eReader Overall</p><h5 id="Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature-Edition-1"><a href="#Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature-Edition-1" class="headerlink" title="Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition"></a>Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</h5><p>If you want all the updates and improvements of the new Paperwhite line, along with an auto-adjusting front light, 32 GB storage, and wireless charging right out of the box, this is the Kindle for you.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon__kindle_paper/6482036.p?skuId=6482036" >See at bestbuy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139122/17108" target="_top" id="2139122">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139122" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139122/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Budget-eReader-Amazon-Kindle-2022"><a href="#Best-Budget-eReader-Amazon-Kindle-2022" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget eReader: Amazon Kindle (2022)"></a>Best Budget eReader: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SWW583J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Amazon Kindle (2022) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kindle-2022.jpg"                      alt="Man holding Amazon Kindle."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938745/19272" target="_top" id="1938745">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938745" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938745/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Amazon</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Small and lightweight</td><td>It isn’t waterproof</td></tr><tr><td>Clear and crisp 300ppi display</td><td>The display isn’t Paperwhite</td></tr><tr><td>16GB of internal eBook storage</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Up to 6 weeks of use from a single charge</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Buying a dedicated eReader isn’t always an easy decision to make, particularly if you don’t know how much you’ll use it. You could go for a refurbished device, but if you prefer your electronics new, the base <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SWW583J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> model is now a more attractive budget option than it’s ever been.</p><p> The 2022 Amazon Kindle received a significant upgrade over the previous base model. It now has a 300ppi display, in line with the more expensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Paperwhite Signature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BS26B8B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Scribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models. Storage has also been bumped up to 16GB, double what it was and enough to hold hundreds of standard eBooks.</p><p> The display is still only six inches, but that helps to make this the smallest and lightest Kindle available. The size difference isn’t huge compared to other Kindles, but it helps make this a device you could hold for hours at a time. Battery life is good, giving you up to six weeks of use from a single charge. You can fully charge the device in around two hours using a <a class="link"   href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/" >USB-C cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a 9V charger plug.</p><p> As you might expect, this Kindle lacks some premium features. The front light has only 4 LEDs and fewer lighting options, the display isn’t Paperwhite, and the device doesn’t have a waterproof rating.</p><p> Like most other Kindle devices, you also have to put up with adverts on the lock screen unless you pay an extra $20 to have them removed. The adverts aren’t very intrusive and don’t impact your reading experience, so choosing an ad-supported model is an easy way to save a few dollars.</p><p> If you are trying eReaders for the first time, the basic Kindle model is a great place to start. Upgrading to the Paperwhite model might only cost $40 more, but if you’re on a tight budget, this is still a brilliant eReader.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kindle-2022.png"                      alt="kindle 2022"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Budget eReader</p><h5 id="Amazon-Kindle-2022-1"><a href="#Amazon-Kindle-2022-1" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Kindle (2022)"></a>Amazon Kindle (2022)</h5><p>The 2022 Amazon Kindle has a 6-inch E ink screen, a USB Type-C port for charging, and 16 GB of internal storage.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/dp/B09SWV3BYH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon__kindle_eread/6520466.p?skuId=6520466" >See at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-eReader-for-Note-Taking-Kobo-Elipsa-2E"><a href="#Best-eReader-for-Note-Taking-Kobo-Elipsa-2E" class="headerlink" title="Best eReader for Note-Taking: Kobo Elipsa 2E"></a>Best eReader for Note-Taking: <a class="link"   href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-elipsa-2e" >Kobo Elipsa 2E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/kobo-elipsa-2e-in-hands-taking-notes-1jpg_53124181777_o.jpg"                      alt="The Kobo Elipsa 2E in a person&#39;s hands while taking notes."                > </p><p>Joe Robinson &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Superb annotation and note-taking tools</td><td>Some software bugs</td></tr><tr><td>Wide range of supported file formats</td><td>Expensive</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent battery life</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> A second-generation model in Kobo’s Elipsa lineup, the <a class="link"   href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-elipsa-2e" >Elipsa 2E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the best eReader for note-taking. Thanks to its impressive features, it even pips the Kindle Scribe. It has a generous 10.3-inch display that looks crisp and is big enough to enjoy everything from eBooks to comics. There is also native support for a wide range of file formats and plenty of reading tools to ensure your eBook appears just as you want. </p><p> The Elipsa 2E comes with the company’s full-size Stylus 2 accessory that you can use to annotate eBooks and PDFs and write in a digital notebook. Your scribbles in the digital notebook can also be converted into digital text or exported to your computer or Dropbox. More importantly, you can annotate any eBook on your eReader. These annotations are also synced to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/apps" >Kobo app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on other devices. </p><p> The stylus features an “eraser” on the other end, which primarily acts as an undo button and not a proper eraser. As it’s an active stylus, you also need to charge it using the USB-C connector. </p><p> The user interface is easy to navigate, and there is built-in support for <a class="link"   href="https://www.overdrive.com/" >Overdrive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to borrow eBooks from a public library. Moreover, like most eReaders, the Elipsa 2E’s battery life is solid and can last weeks on a single charge. </p><p> Unfortunately, some OS bugs occasionally plague the eReader’s performance. However, as these are software issues, we hope the company can fix them in a software update.

The company offers many eReaders, but its <a class="link"   href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/waterproof-ereaders/products/kobo-clara-2e" >Clara 2E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the best option for most people as a straightforward eReader. It houses a 6-inch 300 PPI E Ink display that produces crisp, clear text. You also get an adjustable front light and color temperature, blue light control, and a <a class="link"   href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/citing-ai-tools-correctly-the-step-by-step-process-for-mentioning-chatgpt/" >dark mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a comfortable reading experience. </p><p> Its design is reminiscent of the regular Kindle, which has a recessed display, but Kobo has included a textured back for an enhanced grip. Kobo also does its bit for the environment by making the eReader’s exterior with 85% recycled plastic. </p><p> Another good thing about the Clara 2E’s design is its <a class="link"   href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/" >IPX8 water resistance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which allows you to freely use the eReader around water without worrying about water damage. It’s also relatively lightweight and portable.</p><p> The Kobo offering uses the same software as the company’s other eReaders, meaning you’ll get an easy-to-use interface and OverDrive access to borrow eBooks from a public library. Even though OverDrive has shuttered its standalone app in favor of Libby, its integration in the Kobo eReaders remains functional. </p><p> You get a well-stocked Kobo Store to buy eBooks, and thanks to the native support for several eBook formats and PDFs, you can sideload pretty much any downloaded eBook you want. There is also support for Kobo Audiobooks, but you’ll need a Bluetooth speaker or headphones to listen. Clara 2E’s storage is limited to 16GB, but eBooks don’t take much space, so it’ll be enough for most people. </p><p> Unfortunately, while the eReader’s 1GHz processor delivers acceptable performance, you can occasionally encounter sluggishness navigating the menus and the UI. Otherwise, there is a lot to like about the Kobo Clara 2E.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kobo-clara-2e.png"                      alt="kobo clara 2e"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="864" height="1296" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Non-Kindle Reader</p><h5 id="Kobo-Clara-2E-1"><a href="#Kobo-Clara-2E-1" class="headerlink" title="Kobo Clara 2E"></a>Kobo Clara 2E</h5><p>The Kobo Clara 2E is an excellent eReader for anyone looking for a Kindle alternative.

It’s also IPX8 water-resistant, so if your child spills their drink on it, you don’t need to worry about it getting damaged. </p><p> But in addition to everything from the regular Paperwhite, you also get several extras, which explain the higher price tag of the Kid’s version. For example, you get a nice, kid-friendly case that will look more appealing to kids than the standard Kindle case. You’ll also get a year of <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Amazon Kids+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, providing free access to thousands of popular children’s books. Remember, you’ll have to pay for the Kids+ subscription after the first year. </p><p> Parental controls can help you set time limits and a bedtime, check access details, and lock kids out of purchases so they don’t accidentally buy something. </p><p> You can also borrow eBooks using Overdrive&#x2F; Libby and send them to the Kindle Paperwhite Kids. Unfortunately, like regular Kindle models, there is no way to send downloaded eBooks to a Kindle Kids version. </p><p> Finally, a two-year worry-free warranty means you can quickly get your Kindle replaced or repaired in case of an accident or a technical issue.</p><p> Besides the Paperwhite Kids Edition, Amazon offers a <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLJ6DG25?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Kids version of its regular Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which can be a good alternative for anyone wanting something more affordable. But remember that you’ll sacrifice the water resistance, brighter front light, and flush display, among other significant features.

Get ready for a breath of fresh air with the new <a class="link"   href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour" >Kobo Libra Colour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This addition to the Kobo lineup takes the innovative features of the Libra 2 to the next level. It boasts a 7-inch color E Ink screen, thanks to the cutting-edge Kaleido 3 technology, and even supports stylus use for note-taking, annotations, and more. You’ll have to buy a stylus separately, though. </p><p> The Libra Colour sports the same design as the Libra 2. As a result, it has a slightly curved thick bezel on one edge and two physical page-turn buttons for a comfortable grip and single-hand usage. You also get a textured rear panel to enhance the grip and IPX8 water resistance. </p><p> However, the company has upgraded to a dual-core 2GHz processor, which delivers a largely snappy performance except for specific actions for which the eReader takes slightly more time. Also, being an E Ink device, you must get used to short wait times.</p><p> One of the things that separates Kobo eReaders from other non-Kindle eReaders on the market is the company’s streamlined and easy-to-use user interface. You also get robust file format support with access to 10 document file formats and four image file formats. </p><p> Audiobook support is limited to the company’s audiobooks, available via the Kobo Store. Unfortunately, the eReader has no built-in speaker, and you’ll have to rely on a Bluetooth speaker or headphones to listen. </p><p> Another great thing about the Kobo Libra Colour is its repairability. As it is becoming a growing trend, Kobo has <a class="link"   href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Kobo%5FLibra%5FColour" >partnered with iFixit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to offer parts and tools so you can keep using the Libra Colour for years to come. </p><p> Unfortunately, despite featuring the same Kaleido 3 E Ink display as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/PocketBook-Eye-Friendly-SMARTlight-Audiobooks-Bluetooth%C2%AE/dp/B0CLPFTFYD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >PocketBook InkPad Color 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/PocketBook-Eye-Friendly-Touch-Screen-Audio-Book-Waterproof/dp/B0D1Y883G2/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209600&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/735232/best-ereaders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >PocketBook Era Color <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the colors on the Libra Colour appear a little washed out compared to the PocketBook models. While you’ll get used to it, and the Libra Colour is a much better eReader in many other aspects, including usability, you can consider the PocketBook offerings for a more saturated and vibrant display. The InkPad Color 3, our previous recommendation in this category, has a 7.8-inch screen, whereas the Era Color features a 7-inch display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kobo-libra-color.png"                      alt="kobo libra colour"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135359/19272" target="_top" id="2135359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135359/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best eReader with Color Display</p><h5 id="Kobo-Libra-Colour-1"><a href="#Kobo-Libra-Colour-1" class="headerlink" title="Kobo Libra Colour"></a>Kobo Libra Colour</h5><p>The Kobo Libra Colour shines as a color eReader with its easy-to-use interface, excellent repairability, and ergonomic design.

On top of that, Apple’s <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/read-books-ipadd3c9dc47/ipados" >Reading Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Night Shift are features built with reading in mind, allowing more options than most eReaders provide for making your reading experience comfortable. That’s not even mentioning being able to read in color.</p><p> Of course, going with an LED reading screen has one distinct disadvantage—the glare! E Ink screens are popular for eReaders because they don’t have a glare on the screen when you’re outside, and the iPad mini uses an LED screen.</p><p> Also, the cost of an iPad mini, as great of a tablet as it is, is significantly more expensive than most eReaders on the market. This makes sense, as it does more than just read books, but if color content doesn’t matter to you and you will primarily be reading books, you might <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-16-crowning-youtube-opens-for-enhanced-reach/" >want to reconsider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> However, if you want a tablet that also provides a great reading experience, you won’t be disappointed with the iPad mini.

Different from LCD screens, E Ink displays simulate paper through the use of charged black and white particles and a clear liquid. E Ink displays are believed to cause less eye strain over time than standard electronic screens.</p><h3 id="Do-eReaders-emit-blue-light"><a href="#Do-eReaders-emit-blue-light" class="headerlink" title="Do eReaders emit blue light?"></a><b>Do eReaders emit blue light?</b></h3><p>Despite being different technology than LCD screens, the E Ink displays used in today’s eReaders do still emit blue light. However, the amount produced by the display is less than what you’d be exposed to while using your smartphone or tablet.</p><h3 id="Can-an-iPad-be-an-eReader"><a href="#Can-an-iPad-be-an-eReader" class="headerlink" title="Can an iPad be an eReader?"></a><b>Can an iPad be an eReader?</b></h3><p>While E Ink tends to be the differentiating factor between tablets and eReaders, an iPad can be used in place of an eReader. Apps like Kindle and Overdrive can be downloaded to your Apple device to easily access a library of books and audiobooks. Because of the different displays, you’re more likely to experience eye strain while reading on an iPad over an eReader.</p><h3 id="Can-eReaders-play-audiobooks"><a href="#Can-eReaders-play-audiobooks" class="headerlink" title="Can eReaders play audiobooks?"></a><b>Can eReaders play audiobooks?</b></h3><p>Since many of the apps used by eReaders (Kindle and Overdrive, for example) offer audiobooks, an eReader can be used to listen to audiobooks. Most eReaders come with a standard headset jack or Bluetooth so audiobooks can be enjoyed in public.</p><h3 id="Can-eReaders-surf-the-Internet"><a href="#Can-eReaders-surf-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Can eReaders surf the Internet?"></a><b>Can eReaders surf the Internet?</b></h3><p>Depending on the eReader, you can surf the Internet using the device’s standard web browser.

Today we’re going to show you how to unite all of your (compatible) devices with the remote that came with your TV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1838960/17916" target="_top" id="1838960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1838960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1838960/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="One-Remote-for-All-Functions"><a href="#One-Remote-for-All-Functions" class="headerlink" title="One Remote for All Functions"></a>One Remote for All Functions</h2><p> The benefits of being able to control all your entertainment devices through one single remote are fairly self-explanatory. There’s the fact that having just one remote is good for convenience’s sake, but it goes a little deeper than that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/googletv_remote.jpg"                      alt="Person holding a Chromecast remote infront of a tv with Google TV open."                > </p><p>Jordan Gloor &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> You can scroll through menus, browse streaming services and even control the volume of what you’re watching from the comfort of your couch just like you would a TV. If you have multiple devices in your media repertoire, however, you can go even further and set up a system where your devices will turn on and display themselves on your screen automatically.</p><p> With the right settings, you can even have it so turning on one device automatically powers up the TV as well, making media playback seamless, or changing the volume of each device independently. The benefits do not end there, though, especially for those with a robust home media setup, and it is all made possible through the power of HDMI-CEC.</p><h2 id="The-Ultimate-Solution-HDMI-CEC"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Solution-HDMI-CEC" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Solution: HDMI-CEC"></a>The Ultimate Solution: HDMI-CEC</h2><p> HDMI Consumer Electronics Control, or HDMI-CEC for short, is essentially a single connection wire that can link multiple devices to one input, which can also be compartmentalized internally. In essence, it lets all your devices communicate with each other directly and respond to inputs from a single TV remote.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HDMI-CEC1.jpg"                      alt="Labelled HDMI inputs on the back of a television."                > </p><p>Jason Fitzpatrick &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Most, if not all modern TVs and HDMI media devices are compatible with HDMI-CEC, letting you control your devices directly or even set up automated functions to occur upon startup.

While most TVs manufactured in recent years include this functionality, the tricky part is finding it in your settings.</p><p> You’ll want to be familiar with the name your TV’s manufacturer uses to refer to HDMI-CEC functionality since many of them use in-house names.

However, if your Xbox or PlayStation is a regular part of your media setup, it may be worth controlling it like you would a TV.</p><p> Fortunately, setting up the function is fairly simple, only requiring you to turn on one or two settings from your console’s menu in most cases. These perks don’t all apply if you primarily play games on a monitor, but it’s worth it for a multimedia living room setup.</p><p> On the PlayStation 5, navigate to the console’s HDMI settings under Settings &gt; System &gt; HDMI, where you should find an option called “Enable HDMI Device Link.” You can also turn on “One-Touch Play” to make your PS5 automatically boot up and switch to the proper input upon turning on your TV and “Power Off Link” to make it enter rest mode when your TV shuts off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240503114020.jpg"                      alt="The HDMI Settings menu on the PlayStation 5 with &quot;Enable HDMI Device Link&quot; highlighted."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115946/19272" target="_top" id="2115946">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115946" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115946/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The process is similar for the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S as well, though the settings are a little different; navigate to the console’s settings and go to General &gt; TV &amp; Display Options &gt; TV &amp; Display Options. From there, select “Device Control,” where you can then enable HDMI-CEC and many of its core functions for your console.</p><p> As far as using a TV remote to control a Nintendo Switch is concerned, there is currently no convenient way to do so despite the system being equipped with HDMI-CEC functionalities. However, you can set it up to have your TV turn on automatically by holding down the “Home” button on your controller by just having it connected to HDMI-CEC.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-a-TV-Remote-on-a-Chromecast-and-Apple-TV"><a href="#How-to-Use-a-TV-Remote-on-a-Chromecast-and-Apple-TV" class="headerlink" title="How to Use a TV Remote on a Chromecast and Apple TV"></a>How to Use a TV Remote on a Chromecast and Apple TV</h2><p> Setting up your Chromecast to accept TV remote inputs is as simple as having HDMI-CEC settings turned on on your TV. As long as this is enabled, the Chromecast should automatically allow you to use the remote to navigate streaming services or other functions you may use it for.</p><p> On Apple TV, the process is similarly convenient; simply navigate to your Apple TV settings then go to Remotes and Devices &gt; Learn Remote and select “Start” when prompted. The TV should then prompt you to hold down a few buttons on your remote to fully sync it.</p><p> You should also give your remote a specific name after setting it up so it will be easy to find for later access. Granted, this method primarily expects that you will use the Apple TV remote as your main input across your media setup, though if you’re on an Apple TV, this may already be the case anyway.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2-11.png"                      alt="Apple TV device on a black background."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959712/19272" target="_top" id="1959712">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959712" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959712/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/berlin-germany-august-21-2016-product-471991831" >Lebedev Yury&#x2F;Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you happen to own all or some of the devices covered here, then you may find that they all communicate with each other now provided you have a proper HDMI-CEC set up on your preferred screen. Theoretically, you could not only control your devices with one TV remote, you can also set them all up to switch inputs automatically upon booting up, reducing the amount of time and inputs necessary to start up your media or gaming sessions.</p><p> Apple TV users can always just use their packed-in remote control or <a class="link"   href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/vn-video-editor-android-app-is-it-worth-downloading-for-2024/" >the companion iPhone app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but for others, any Bluetooth-enabled remote will work just fine. If you’re looking for affordable options, an Amazon Fire TV remote is easy to get your hands on, or the PlayStation TV remote, both of which are compatible with Bluetooth devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/52567799489_3a2368a422_o.jpg"                      alt="Person holding the Amazon Alexa Voice Remote Pro"                > </p><p>Hannah Stryker &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Say goodbye to relying on a console’s controller to whenever you want to watch Netflix or getting up to find a missing remote.

Blu-rays provide superior video and audio quality to <a class="link"   href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >streaming services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You also don’t need to rely on internet speeds or any internet at all, for that matter.</p><p> However, when buying a player for your Blu-rays and DVDs, you’ll need to consider some essential factors first. To begin with, you need to assess disc compatibility. Some Blu-ray players are region-locked. This means they are incompatible with any disc from outside the region where you bought it. Make sure your player is not region-locked if you plan on buying discs from outside your country.</p><p> You should also consider the formats that the player is compatible with. There’s little point in buying a standard Full HD (1080p) Blu-ray player if all your discs are 4K—they simply won’t play. However, by purchasing a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player, you can upscale lower-res discs, including standard Blu-rays and DVDs. You may also plan on purchasing 3D Blu-rays, but you’ll need a compatible player to play these, as well as a TV that supports this format.</p><p> HDR (or high-dynamic-range) compatibility is another essential consideration. In a perfect world, all players will support Dolby Vision, <a class="link"   href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/" >HDR10+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, HDR10, and HLG. However, Blu-ray players are often selective in their support, so ensure it is compatible with your favored HDR format before purchase.</p><p> Most Blu-ray players will also play CDs, but it’s worthwhile to check if audio is part of your plans. Not all players will support high-resolution audio formats like DVD-Audio (DVD-A) and SACD (Super Audio CD). If you consider yourself an audiophile and you want the best sound from your player, it’s best to check that it supports these formats.</p><h2 id="Best-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Overall-Panasonic-DP-UB820-K"><a href="#Best-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Overall-Panasonic-DP-UB820-K" class="headerlink" title="Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player Overall: Panasonic DP-UB820-K"></a>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player Overall: <a class="link"   href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Panasonic DP-UB820-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub820-k.jpg"                      alt="A Panasonic DP-UB820-K under a giant, vibrant TV screen."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148641/16836" target="_top" id="2148641">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148641" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="254" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148641/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Panasonic</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Outstanding image quality</td><td>App selection is pretty limited</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent audio</td><td>Impractical remote</td></tr><tr><td>Supports all major HDR formats</td><td>Quite big</td></tr><tr><td>Good value</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Various connectivity options</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Our top overall pick for the best Blu-ray and DVD player is the <a class="link"   href="https://amazon.com/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Panasonic DP-UB820-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is available at a decent midrange price and delivers impeccable image quality with excellent audio. This player is ideal for a 4K home theater setup and will provide years of viewing pleasure thanks to its durable build. It supports <a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/" >4K Ultra HD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Blu-rays, standard Blu-rays, 3D Blu-rays, and DVDs. It will also play any CDs from your collection.</p><p> 4K Blu-rays look especially incredible when played through the UB820. Panasonic’s Hollywood Cinema Experience (HCX) tech ensures colors stand out with natural saturation, while blacks are deep and inky against the vibrant chroma. Details are sharp and textured without being overly dramatic, and the player supports HDR formats such as Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG. It also effectively upscales to 4K, breathing new life into your lower-resolution discs.</p><p> With support for <a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >Dolby Atmos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and DTS:X, the audio complements the picture well with a good speaker setup.

These include two HDMI options with one A&#x2F;V and one audio, a digital optical output for high-quality audio to your external sound system, and two USB ports for playing media from an external hard drive or USB stick.</p><p> The player also supports analog audio output, although fussy audiophiles will likely not be too impressed with the sound quality. Another downside is the remote. Its overcrowded buttons and lack of backlighting make it difficult to use in a dimmed room. Additionally, while the build is lightweight and durable, you can still hear the discs spinning at times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub820-k.png"                      alt="Panasonic DP-UB820-K"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player Overall</p><h5 id="Panasonic-DP-UB820-K-1"><a href="#Panasonic-DP-UB820-K-1" class="headerlink" title="Panasonic DP-UB820-K"></a>Panasonic DP-UB820-K</h5><p>$420 $498 Save $78 </p><p>The Panasonic DP-UB820-K offers exceptional 4K image quality, vibrant colors, and striking contrast at a reasonable price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$420 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Panasonic-DP-UB820-K-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-ray-Player-with-HDR10-and-Dolby-Vision-Playback/352729721" >See at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=2QzUaswX1as&mid=44583&u1=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&murl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fareyouahuman%253Freferer%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.newegg.com%25252Fp%25252F12K-005E-002M2&ourl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fp%252F12K-005E-002M2" >See at Newegg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Budget-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Panasonic-DP-UB154-K"><a href="#Best-Budget-Blu-Ray-and-DVD-Player-Panasonic-DP-UB154-K" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Blu-Ray and DVD Player: Panasonic DP-UB154-K"></a>Best Budget Blu-Ray and DVD Player: <a class="link"   href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Panasonic-4K-Blu-Ray-Player-Ultra-HD-Premium-Video-Playback-and-Hi-Res-Audio-DP-UB150-K/852048134" >Panasonic DP-UB154-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub154-k.jpg"                      alt="A Panasonic DP-UB154-K"                > </p><p><em>Panasonic</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Excellent picture quality</td><td>No Dolby Vision</td></tr><tr><td>Effective upscaling</td><td>Awkward menu system</td></tr><tr><td>Affordable</td><td>Basic remote</td></tr></tbody></table><p> If you seek something for playing 4K Blu-ray discs without all the extra fluff, the <a class="link"   href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Panasonic-4K-Blu-Ray-Player-Ultra-HD-Premium-Video-Playback-and-Hi-Res-Audio-DP-UB150-K/852048134" >Panasonic DP-UB154-K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is for you.

This is particularly evident in its picture quality, which is among the best you’ll find in a Blu-ray player.</p><p> The 4K pops out with color and detail. In bright scenes, details are sharp, and the HDR optimizer does a great job of fine-tuning content for an even better picture. Colors are energetic, and gradations are silky, making this the ultimate 4K Blu-ray player despite the high price. Even the advanced 4K upscaling ensures low-res DVDs are close to UHD quality.</p><p> The DP-UB9000 supports all major <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/" >HDR formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, including Dolby Vision and HDR10+. But this Blu-ray player excels in more than just picture quality. The audio is also top-notch with the DP-UB9000. Dialog is sharp, music is detailed with subtle nuances you might not usually hear, and there is a spacious soundstage. Of course, you’ll need a good speaker setup, which the player supports via its 7.1 multichannel audio output.</p><p> Audiophiles may be disappointed to learn that the player lacks DVD-Audio and SACD support. However, less particular music fans can play their CDs just fine. On top of the 7.1 channel output, there are also a plethora of connectivity options. These include dual HDMI outputs that allow separate audio and video handling for improved quality, balanced XLR&#x2F;RCA outputs for interference-free stereo playback, and optical and coaxial outputs for pristine digital sound.</p><p> Finally, if build quality is a major consideration for you, go ahead and add this player to your cart, as it feels indestructible at times. It features a heavy steel chassis and an aluminum top panel, which keeps vibrations and noise to a minimum. This is further enhanced by the steel plate on the disc drive and effective anti-slip pads on the bottom. It’s a weighty Blu-ray player, but it can take a bit of abuse.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/panasonic-dp-ub9000.png"                      alt="Panasonic DP-UB9000"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151894/7443" target="_top" id="2151894">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151894" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151894/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best 4K Blu-Ray and DVD Player</p><h5 id="Panasonic-DP-UB9000-1"><a href="#Panasonic-DP-UB9000-1" class="headerlink" title="Panasonic DP-UB9000"></a>Panasonic DP-UB9000</h5><p>The Panasonic DP-UB9000 is a premium Blu-ray player that delivers exceptional picture and audio quality, with support for all major HDR formats and extensive connectivity options.

It’s relatively affordable and offers an excellent audiovisual experience. The 4K UHD picture competes well, even with more premium offerings, and the 4K upscaling does a good job, too. This means you can get those old DVD box sets out and enjoy them again, but this time, with a high level of sharpness and vibrancy.</p><p> The UBP-X800M2 supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG video formats. Unfortunately, there is no HDR10+ support, although most high-res audio formats, including SACD and DVD-A, are supported. Given the player’s price, it offers impressive musical quality and handles it with a high level of precision and energy. Sony’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00230269" >DSEE HX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technology also restores the detail and clarity of compressed audio files, making them sound closer to high-resolution content.</p><p> With dual-band Wi-Fi, the X800 supports 2.4 and 5GHz networks. This is an improvement on its more affordable predecessor, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Theater-Streaming-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B08ZFYVS9T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Sony UBP-X700M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which supported only single-band 2.4GHz. This upgrade offers a more stable Wi-Fi performance, but it is improved even further by the player’s MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) technology. This tech uses multiple transmitters and receivers to transfer more data simultaneously. You can enjoy faster and more stable streaming than usual, and you can even venture a bit further away from your router than you might typically do.</p><p> But it’s with 4K streaming that you can see this technology display its full potential when handling the required high data transfer rates. However, it’s worth noting that, like most DVD players, streaming services are limited. With the X800, you are restricted to Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube. The player’s other connectivity options include dual HDMI for separate audio and visual output, USB, digital coaxial out, Ethernet, and Bluetooth.</p><p> Regarding the design, it is very minimalist. In fact, it is so unadorned that you may not even know the player is on, given there is no display of any kind. Even the power indicator is so discreet that it’s almost imperceptible. However, it has a sturdier construction than previously, with its metal chassis making it more durable. However, this adds to the weight, making it heavier than its predecessor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sony-ubp-x800m2.png"                      alt="Sony UBP-X800M2"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player with Wi-Fi</p><h5 id="Sony-UBP-X800M2-1"><a href="#Sony-UBP-X800M2-1" class="headerlink" title="Sony UBP-X800M2"></a>Sony UBP-X800M2</h5><p>$178 $260 Save $82 </p><p>The Sony UBP-X800M2 offers excellent 4K picture quality and high-res audio performance at a reasonable price point.

It’s a 10.1-inch compact player with two screens that play standard Blu-rays, DVDs, CDs, and video files from an SD card or USB drive. Note that this is not a 4K Blu-ray player and is incompatible with anything higher than 1080p (Full HD).</p><p> Despite this, Full HD video does look very good on the displays. The audio is surprisingly good, too, with dual stereo speakers loud enough to go headphone-free. At the same time, their front-facing design helps to avoid disturbing passengers in the front.</p><p> However, sometimes, younger kids’ shows can get on the repetitive side for adults who are focusing on their driving skills. In this case, there is a headphone jack on each display that you can utilize, allowing you to take control of the noise levels in the car. However, there is no Bluetooth, so if you wish to use wireless headphones with the player, you’ll need an adapter, such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Transmitter-Headphones-Airplanes/dp/B07Z13H4TP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004822&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/best-blu-ray-and-dvd-players/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Twelve South AirFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> The included AV in&#x2F;out cable connects the dual screens, and you can conveniently strap each display to the front seat headrests. The battery life is around three hours, enough for at least one (long) movie, but you can also power the player with your 12V car adapter. This ensures even the longest road trip can be filled with the joys of Pixar and Disney’s finest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/naviskauto-dual-screen-blu-ray-dvd-player.png"                      alt="A NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player with remote."                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129042/19576" target="_top" id="2129042">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129042" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129042/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Blu-Ray and DVD Player for Travel</p><h5 id="NAVISKAUTO-Dual-Screen-Blu-Ray-DVD-Player-1"><a href="#NAVISKAUTO-Dual-Screen-Blu-Ray-DVD-Player-1" class="headerlink" title="NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player"></a>NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player</h5><p>The NAVISKAUTO Dual Screen Blu-Ray DVD Player is an excellent entertainment solution for family road trips.

Most of them are designed to play at least Blu-ray, DVD, and CD formats. But if playing music is a major factor for you, you may also wish to consider SACD, DVD-A, and other high-resolution audio formats. Check for compatibility beforehand if this is the case. </p><h3 id="Can-gaming-consoles-play-Blu-rays-If-so-which-ones"><a href="#Can-gaming-consoles-play-Blu-rays-If-so-which-ones" class="headerlink" title="Can gaming consoles play Blu-rays?

Certain next-gen systems support 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays, such as the standard PS5 and the Xbox One X. However, it’s important to note that the PS5 (Digital Edition) and the Xbox Series S do not have disc drives and will not play any Blu-rays or other discs. </p><p> The PS3, PS4, and PS4 Pro, and the original Xbox One support standard Blu-rays only. In other words, they won’t play 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays, just regular, old Full HD (1080p) discs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Are-Blu-rays-better-than-streaming"><a href="#Are-Blu-rays-better-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Are Blu-rays better than streaming?"></a>Are Blu-rays better than streaming?</h3><p> There are pros and cons, so it depends on the individual. Blu-rays offer a superior audio and visual experience, especially when watching in 4K.

While I’ve built up great cities on earth, there is one place I haven’t been to: outer space. Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137378/7443" target="_top" id="2137378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying"><a href="#Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Humans have never been so annoying"></a><strong>Performance: Humans have never been so annoying</strong></h2><p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137216/26400" target="_top" id="2137216">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137216" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137216/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1516072">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1516072%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1516072/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms.

well</li></ul><p> While many of the best external optical drives go for a smaller form factor, making them easier to travel, this pick for top performance goes big. The ASUS BW-16D1X-U measures 2.48 x 6.50 x 9.57 inches, making it a bit of a desk hog, but with that extra size, you get serious performance for every task.</p><p> The ASUS BW-16D1X-U has fast access times on all types of optical media, so you’ll spend less time waiting around. It can access CD-ROM at 160ms, DVD-ROM at 170ms, and BD-ROM at 180ms. Its read and write performance is also stellar, with 40x, 16x, and 8x read speeds in CD, DVD, and Blu-ray, respectively. Likewise, it can burn CD-R at 40x, DVD-R at 16x, and BD-R at 16x.</p><p> So, whether you want to rip media from discs or burn data to them, the Asus BW-16D1X-U can do the job quickly. It also supports BDXL, allowing storage of up to 128GB on a single, compatible disc. Making the package even sweeter, the ASUS BW-16D1X-U supports Windows and Mac computers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-bw-16d1x-u-blu-ray-drive-review-4774686" >Asus BW-16D1X-U Powerful Blu-ray Drive Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >LG GP65NB60 External Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Txzj4YX23tuIUnOsOlRGMfzEON8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-electronics-8x-usb-20-super-multi-ultra-slim-portable-dvd-writer-drive---rw-external-drive-with-m-disc-support-black-gp65nb60-e74c64d858fc4e968d809333a31078d1.jpg" >LG Electronics 8X USB 2.0 Super Multi Ultra Slim Portable DVD Writer Drive +&#x2F;-RW External Drive with M-DISC Support (Black) GP65NB60 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >$25 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Reads and writes CDs and DVDs</li><li>Lightweight and very portable</li><li>You have color options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Cheap build quality</li><li>Poorly designed eject function</li></ul><p> If you don’t need the Blu-ray capabilities offered by some of the more premium external optical drives, you can get a great deal on a CD&#x2F;DVD drive. LG’s GP65NB60 is a low-profile and affordable combo drive that offers both read and write capability for CD and DVD. Measuring 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches and weighing just 0.4 pounds, it even gives our top compact pick a run for its money.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 can read CD-ROM at 24x speeds and DVD-ROM at 8x speeds, meaning it’s not lagging behind most of the competition despite its budget price. Write speeds are also decent, with up to 24x on CD-R and up to 8x on DVD-R.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 needs a single USB connection for all its power and data transfer needs. Further rounding out the package, the LG GP65NB60 supports Windows and Mac, can burn archival-quality M-Disc, and comes in various colors, with black, gold, white, and silver on offer.</p><h2 id="Most-Compact"><a href="#Most-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Most Compact"></a>Most Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >Verbatim External Slimline Blu-ray Writer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BO4kmGezMrCvhvw2CCVi4n592BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/verbatim-external-cd-dvd-blu-ray-writer-usb-30-m-disc-ready---movie-playback-requires-playback-software-not-included-67c2a99c85c4425298b176462124e43b.jpg" >Verbatim External CD DVD Blu-ray Writer USB 3.0 M-Disc Ready - Movie playback requires playback software (not included) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid metal case</li><li>M-Disc support</li><li>Comes with USB Type-C adapter</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t include software</li><li>Isn’t cheap</li><li>Fragile tray</li></ul><p> Many modern laptops forgo an optical drive to trim their size and weight. But that reduction wouldn’t be valuable if you need an optical drive.</p><p> Measuring just 0.45 x 5.24 x 5.75 inches, the Verbatim 70102 is super compact. What’s more, the reduction in size doesn’t mean a bunch of compromises. It’s built with metal housing for a premium look and feel and is speedy.</p><p> It can write CDs at 24x, DVDs at 8x, and Blu-rays at 6x — even supporting M-Disc. It’s a CD&#x2F;DVD&#x2F;BD drive weighing less than half a pound. The Verbatim 70102 is a mobility champion, with power and data transfer over USB, so you’ll only need one cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Alternative"><a href="#Budget-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Budget Alternative"></a>Budget Alternative</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >Dell DW316 External USB Slim DVD Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uXbXWSHrSmk0WgSQeogs9WgkNz0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316--black-5ec791f7068744c3bc87e2e91130a9c1.jpg" >dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316–black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >$26 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/EXT-USB-SLIM-DVD-RW-OPTICAL-DRIVE-429-AAUX/44933803" >$34 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-usb-slim-dvd-rw-drive-plug-and-play-dw316-black/4697703.p?skuId=4697703" >$40 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works immediately</li><li>Includes DVD burning software</li><li>Easy to move around</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>A bit pricey for what you get</li><li>Flimsy exterior</li></ul><p> The Dell DW316 measures 0.55 x 5.41 x 5.67 inches, making it both a budget and compact contender.

Furthering that performance are quick access times; the Asus ZenDrive can access CD and DVD content in 160ms. For anyone who needs archival quality, the ZenDrive also supports burning to M-Disc for long-lasting data storage.</p><p> The Asus ZenDrive supports Windows and Mac, and it includes CyberLink software to help you get started storing content on physical media. The drive also comes with six months of free cloud storage from ASUS, so you can rip content from your CDs and DVDs and move it there as needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> For people who own and consume lots of media, an indispensable external optical drive is one of your best bets. External optical drives allow you to store massive amounts of data, including photos, videos, and software from CDs and DVDs, with easy access whenever and wherever you need it.</p><p> With hundreds of external optical drives on the market, finding the right one may take a lot of work. However, we’ve narrowed our top selections to the top four. We evaluated using five criteria: connectivity, compatibility, read&#x2F;write speeds, portability, and optional features such as low power consumption and M-Disc support.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p><p> Our preferred external optical drive supports USB 3.0 or higher for faster data transfer speeds. It should also be compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android OS, and FireOS, which is preferable for users with multiple devices running different file types of all sizes.</p><p> Almost all external optical drives have a micro USB port, although the larger mini USB can save more files.</p><p> Other areas to consider with connectivity include BDXL support, which allows you to store all your files on a 128GB disc.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> In addition to supporting standard CDs and DVDs, bolster your data processing power by choosing models with Blu-ray disc support. Ensure your preferred format is supported to avoid any returns due to compatibility issues.</p><p> If you store a lot of precious digital data, like family photos, you may want to explore external optical drives offering M-Disc support. These drives promise to last 1,000 years versus 7-10 years for standard DVDs before losing image quality.</p><p><strong>Read&#x2F;Write Speeds</strong></p><p> In short, the faster the read and write speeds, the quicker it will take to transfer large files or burn discs. Read speeds indicate how long it takes to open files, while write speeds indicate how long it takes to save data. At a minimum, look for read and write speeds of 40x (CDs), 16x (DVDs), and 16x (Blu-ray), although the higher, the better. No wonder why our Best Overall pick is the ASUS BW-16D1X-U Blu-ray Drive with read speeds of 8x (Blu-ray), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD) versus write speeds of 16x (BD-R), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD).</p><p><strong>Portability</strong></p><p> If you’re constantly on the go, we highly recommend a slim and lightweight design that is easy to carry around. One perfect example is the LG GP65NB60 External Drive, which is only 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches. It should be small enough to fit in a laptop bag, person, or backpack. Plus, many of them come with integrated cables, which keep your bags clutter-free and cord-free.</p><p><strong>Optional Features</strong></p><p> Other areas to consider when choosing an external optical drive are its durability and build quality. Check for ones with anti-scratch coatings, shock resistance, and sturdy construction to withstand wear and tear, especially when traveling, as they constantly get knocked in your luggage.</p><p> On the usability side, you may also enjoy external optical drives with silent operation and low power consumption, which offer a more comfortable working environment.</p><p> Kudos for any external optical drive with M-Disc support, as well as bundled backup software or free subscriptions to cloud services that offer even more robust backups.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cd-players-and-changers-1846562" >The Best CD Players and CD Changers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of an optical drive?<br> With media increasingly moving to digital rather than physical storage solutions, an optical drive may seem outdated. But there are still many reasons to invest in an optical drive, not the least of which is to access older media, a significant percentage of which still hasn’t been shifted to a digital&#x2F;online solution. This is especially true if you have games, videos, photos, or documents backed up on physical media. Optical drives can also be a handy way to create new backups quickly and inexpensively, and some programs require discs for emergency boot tools.</li><li>Can you read a DVD in a Blu-Ray drive?<br> Yes, both CDs and DVDs are compatible with Blu-Ray drives, and there are combo drives that can burn discs of all three types as well. By contrast, DVD drives cannot read Blu-Ray media.</li><li>How does an optical drive work?<br> Optical drives read and write data to discs using a laser. The laser creates pits in an organic dye layer on the disc’s surface to write, the reflected light from which can then be read by photodiodes in the drive and converted back into the original data. The disc spins, allowing the laser to read the tracks on its surface consecutively. If you’re not using a CD, dozens of supported YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> channels specialize in Karaoke videos, such as Singtrix and Sing King.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition packs all the functionality of an Amazon Fire TV streaming device right into its chassis. This 55-inch LED smart TV combines affordability with Alexa, Amazon Prime content, and access to over 500,000 episodes across your favorite streaming platforms. We thoroughly tested the Toshiba’s picture quality, display settings, and the Fire OS interface and usability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pCLBMqSK1Hi3ePW2jzUkDycA2IU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_04-f1f62a55ea504fc9aa98fc9e14527ba7.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room"><a href="#Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room" class="headerlink" title="Design: Best for a bigger room"></a><strong>Design: Best for a bigger room</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55-inch Fire TV is not a small device. While it only weighs 31.3 pounds with the stand (though the stand itself weighs less than a pound), it’s both tall and wide enough to make moving and installing it a two-person job. The TV’s dimensions with the stand are 27.8 inches tall, 44.6 inches wide, and 10.7 inches deep, and the screen size (on a diagonal) measures at 49.5 inches.</p><p> There’s no wall mount included in the box, but there are four standard VESA mounting holes on the back of the unit for safe and easy installation. In a smaller space, wall-mounting this television might not be a bad idea. Even in the relatively modestly-sized room where we tested the TV, it nearly completely took up the entire shelf where we placed it and a broad swath of the wall behind it. This TV is not particularly thin and actually tends to be a bit bulky in the very back of the unit, and the stand also adds width. The legs splay out and require a wide, long surface to accommodate them.</p><p> An attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500.</p><p> The other important component is the Alexa-enabled remote, which is small, lightweight, and contains a circular dial with directional controls and play&#x2F;pause functionality. You also have the benefit of summoning Alexa with the touch of the speaker button, which is intuitively placed at the top of the remote (though we often accidentally hit it when we were trying to push the Home button, which is right below it).</p><p> The buttons are clearly laid out on the remote, and it’s convenient to have volume and mute controls in addition to a shortcut button to antenna channels. There are also some shortcut buttons as well: Prime Video, Nextflix, HBO, and Vue.</p><p> There are some downsides to the remote’s overall quality. Unlike other Fire TV remotes that create a completely smooth and seamless effect on the back, this remote is a lot more traditional, with a tab for pulling off the battery cover. It makes an unfortunate creaking noise almost every time you push a button, and while it never fell off the noise was distracting and contributed to the plastic and flimsy feel of the remote.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bohXBE5CBPeYtI5seooxoQhyzkY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_02-781cfad0cacf41878e3ffb24afd56c6e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> There is a little setup required out of the box, whether you wall mount it or attach the stand. We chose the latter and found the instructions to be straightforward. Each leg requires both a longer 35 mm screw to help create a secure attachment to the bottom of the TV and two 10 mm screws that secure the legs to the back of the unit.</p><p> Installing the legs isn’t complicated, but it can be awkward because you need to place the TV screen-side down on a soft or cushioned surface. It helps to have a bit of space to do this either on a sofa or a clean, carpeted area, and maybe a helping hand to situate the TV wherever you plan to put it.</p><p> Once the legs were in place, we placed the TV on a table and plugged in the power cord. The TV powered on immediately and we were prompted to press the play&#x2F;pause button on the remote to begin setup.</p><p> We were guided through a quick process of connecting to Wi-Fi, signing in with Amazon account credentials, and registering the TV to our account. While you can enjoy this television without an existing Amazon account, you will have to create one in order to complete setup and gain access to all apps. The whole setup only takes a few moments, though, and we were on the Home screen of the Fire OS interface before we knew it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gg5qCbaSxBZF2n4hLJ-UWMjX7vk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_05-ea81ea03abde49c3856c921f1321d024.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking</strong></h2><p> While setting up the TV was very fast and took only a few minutes, we did have to spend some time adjusting the picture settings. Unfortunately, this is not something the online user manual provides much insight about.</p><p> We headed straight for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> content on Amazon Prime and played a number of movies and TV series. What we found was that it consistently took about a minute for the picture to kick into Ultra HD<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The default standard picture settings yielded an incredibly dark picture with too much contrast. The reds were very exaggerated and the low-light scenes, especially scenes at night, were very difficult to see.</p><p> Accessing the HDR picture settings is not exactly intuitive. Long-pressing the Home button on the remote brings up a shortcut menu and that’s where we were able to access HDR picture settings. Picture settings can be found under Display and Sounds in the main Settings menu, but there’s only a blanket setting for all app and video content. Settings that work for regular HD content, which was the majority of the content we viewed, were inadequate for HDR content.</p><p>Ultra HD HDR content shines in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> For the best Ultra HD HDR picture quality, we found that changing to movie mode instead of standard smoothed out the saturation a bit. For good measure we also turned off Dynamic Backlight, HDR Tone Mapping, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mpeg-file-2622031" >MPEG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Noise Reduction. This helped the Ultra HD HDR content shine in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> Another image quality issue we encountered was<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macroblocking-and-pixelation-1847333" >video artifacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which are glitches and distortions in picture quality. This can be a result of data loss due to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-media-file-compression-1847431" >media file compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , signal interference, or other factors. It was a particular problem when viewing HD Amazon Prime content, but we also observed it in Hulu content. Turning off Edge Enhancer and Motion Processing from the picture settings menu helped eliminate artifacting when streaming media, but it didn’t resolve this issue when we watched live TV via Hulu. There we got long sequences of pixelated content and macroblocking, where the image appeared broken up into blocky chunks.</p><p> We did switch the picture mode to Game when playing an HD game, but didn’t notice a significant difference in quality. The picture was already quite vibrant and clear without making this switch, and the only discernible difference was that Game mode made color tones a bit more saturated. Presumably the panel is deactivating some post-processing to improve input lag, but we didn’t notice a significant difference in either quality or latency.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KHIDIBlAKmxc6ZGa6AocjOoGEpY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_06-1fe0d195f3844b89822833f4c0f4d69e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135375/19272" target="_top" id="2135375">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135375" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135375/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 is outfitted with two 10-watt speakers enhanced with DTS Studio Sound. According to DTS, this technology smooths transitions, volume, and bass levels while changing channels or sources.</p><p> Audio quality isn’t spectacular but is generally consistent and clear across media. The volume can get quite loud and fill the room, which is good if you don’t plan to add additional home-entertainment speakers. There are also bass, treble, and balancing settings that help cater to your individual EQ preferences.</p><p> Like the suite of picture settings, there are sound modes to achieve the most appropriate audio experience based on what media you’re consuming. These modes include Standard, Movie, Music, Clear Voice, and a user-defined Custom mode. Movie mode seemed to work out best for our preferences, yielding neither an extremely tinny nor bassy sound.</p><p> There are also the DTS TruSurround and TruVolume controls—TruSurround is on by default and functions to create a richer and more amplified sound, but TruVolume is off. Flipping it on helped control and even out fluctuations in sound, which was a problem we encountered streaming some content on Netflix and Hulu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FdoBEgX__hYz6EgBVAeh47z5pyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_03-39faf55a89c8450cbddcb795f2f0fcc8.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered"><a href="#Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy to use but cluttered"></a><strong>Software: Easy to use but cluttered</strong></h2><p> This Toshiba TV runs on Fire OS, which is easy to interact with but has some quirks. As an Amazon product it feature Amazon Prime content first and foremost, which may be convenient for Prime subscribers but is slightly less so if you’re primarily looking for Netflix or Hulu content. We found that the remote occasionally lagged if we didn’t point it directly toward the TV sensors, and virtually any time we loaded and exited apps or spun up Prime content. Loading time varied from a few seconds to upwards of ten. There’s also an odd bug when exiting out of the Hulu app. It routinely took about five seconds before the system got us back to the Home dashboard, before which it would take us to the Hulu home page.</p><p> The Fire OS Home menu is the spot that features recent apps, downloaded apps, as well as suggested content based on viewing activity. This arrangement is clear enough, but wading through options becomes more confusing based on the other menu pages, which include Movies, Live, TV Shows, Apps, and Your Videos. Much of the content you’ll see across these pages is duplicated, so overlap is a part of the user experience, which means clutter and confusion. Once you get a handle on this arrangement it’s easy enough to wade through, but a more streamlined layout would be welcome.</p><p> One way to avoid what can feel like a labored navigation experience is to use Alexa. But that doesn’t always make the process any easier. When testing commands like “Tune to ABC” in Hulu Live, we encountered a bunch of error messages.

It’s considerably lighter than other smart TVs that skew more toward the $1,000 price range and offers solid sound and picture quality, plus instant access to myriad streaming apps and services.</p><p> If you’re thinking about cutting the cord with a streaming media player and purchasing a new TV, this Toshiba TV is a solid option that won’t require you to pay through the nose. It’s even more appealing if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber and if you like the idea of a built-in voice assistant.</p><h2 id="Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV"><a href="#Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV" class="headerlink" title="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch   Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV"></a><strong>Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch</strong>   <strong>Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a happy medium between features&#x2F;functionality, saving space, and affordability, the TCL 50S425 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Roku TV may be a worthy option. This smart 4K television retails for under $400 and blends 4K Ultra HD quality with HDR, resulting in vivid and exceptional picture quality for the price. The Roku TV is not only cheaper than the Toshiba Fire TV Edition, but it’s also 1 pound lighter despite being both slightly taller, wider, and deeper than the Toshiba 55LF711U20.</p><p> The other benefit of the Roku TV is the interface, which is more streamlined than the Fire OS dashboard. If you’re not overly enthusiastic about Alexa or Google Assistant, you could choose to integrate either down the line with the Roku—since it’s compatible with both—or forego them altogether. Alternatively, the Roku app also offers a handy mobile remote and voice control. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber you’ll still have easy access to that content through the Prime app, though it won’t be as prominent, which is actually a boon.</p><p> Consider some of our other picks for the best cheap TVs or the best TVs under $500.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A capable smart TV for active Amazon Prime users.</strong></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition is a big, bold, affordable 4K smart TV that’s ideal for Amazon Prime subscribers and Alexa users. It offers solid sound and picture quality, especially once you’ve chosen the configuration that work best for your viewing preferences.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tcl-50s425-50-inch-roku-tv-2019-review-4772224" >TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/insignia-ns-43df710na19-fire-tv-edition-review-4770716" >Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-xbr49x900f-49-inch-4k-ultra-hd-smart-led-tv-review-4796665" >Sony XBR49X900F 49-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</li><li>Product Brand  Toshiba</li><li>MPN  55LF711U20</li><li>Price  $449.99</li><li>Weight  31.3 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  27.8 x 44.6 x 10.7 in.</li><li>Platform  Fire OS</li><li>Screen Size  49.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160 pixels (4K)</li><li>Ports:  HDMI x 3, USB, Ethernet, A&#x2F;C power, Headphone, Analog Audio, Digital Audio</li><li>Formats Supported  HD, 4K UHD, HDR</li><li>Speakers  Two 10-watt DTS Studio</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/astering-the-art-of-incorporating-youtube-in-slate-presentations-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering the Art of Incorporating YouTube in Slate Presentations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-decoding-your-path-to-prominence-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Decoding Your Path to Prominence on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/affordable-protection-the-ultimate-review-of-the-procase-macbook-pro-13-case/"><u>Affordable Protection: The Ultimate Review of the ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/ceo-exit-at-openai-pondering-on-gpt/"><u>CEO Exit at OpenAI, Pondering on GPT?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/compact-and-efficient-ourlink-usb-wireless-adapter-model-u631/"><u>Compact & Efficient OURLINK USB Wireless Adapter -

These skins are usually designed by a player and uploaded to a website for people to download and enjoy. They can also be designed specifically for the person who created it. In the Pocket, Console, and Windows 10 Editions of the game, however, Mojang has been known to get their hands dirty in terms of creating their own skins and releasing them for all of their audiences to enjoy. In this article, we will be discussing MInecraft’s “<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/" >Campfire Tales <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “ skin pack. Let’s talk about this.</p><h2 id="Halloween"><a href="#Halloween" class="headerlink" title="Halloween"></a>Halloween</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6eBth_cNXyUbw7QNSSRjRVSyMg8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/MC_Campfire_Tales_Blog_1024x576-58058f245f9b5805c27e632c.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Minecraft &#x2F; Mojang</p><p> When Halloween comes around, these skins will definitely tickle your fancy in the area of spookiness. As the “Campfire Tales” skin pack is catered to the idea that the name suggests, it’s easy to come to the conclusion that these skins were designed to bring a new realm of creativity to the player, allowing them to make their own stories in-game or within their imagination. Each skin supposedly has its own story, with Mojang sharing a few of them in their recent post mentioning their existence. These various stories have been noted in the form of poems, with Ol’ Diggy’s and The Sea-Swallowed Captain’s being released.</p><p> Ol’ Diggy’s story has been noted as, “In mines and lonely caverns deep, you sometimes hear the sound: The tunk-tunk-tunk- of Diggy’s pick still prying at the ground. But light a torch and no one’s there, just shadows on the wall - No glimpse of Diggy’s greedy shade, still searching for his haul.”</p><p> The Sea-Swallowed Captain’s story was released stating, “Upon the black and wicked sea, The Captain did once sail, until it called her to its depths with lightning, wind, and hail. Some say she stalks the salt-stained shores, a briney, weed-wrapped wight, seeking young folk to join her crew, down in eternal night.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sixteen-Skins"><a href="#Sixteen-Skins" class="headerlink" title="Sixteen Skins"></a>Sixteen Skins</h2><p> In the “Minecraft: Campfire Tales” skin pack, players can assure themselves that they will have a very large diversity in terms of appearances they can use within the game. Sixteen skins are included within the pack for players to use at their leisure. The diversity included in this pack is enough to keep a player consistently going back and wondering if he or she should change their skin or not. I feel that factor as a whole is a huge point in why this skin pack is great.</p><p> While some of these skins may appear “normal” at first, dedicated players will notice their interesting characteristics. On the PC edition of the game (the regular, not Windows 10 Edition), players are limited in terms of what “sticks out” on a skin. A while back, ​<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/" >Mojang <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> added the support for an extra layer to be added on to certain areas of the “Minecraft” character’s body. These new skins, however, are completely “new” models. While the models interact with the environment like any other model, their appearances are more altered. Some skins like “The Sea-Swallowed Captain” feature a hat extending out multiple pixels past the original length, all the while also featuring interesting tidbits like a skinnier leg to be perceived as a peg-leg.</p><p> These various additions bring a new level of artistic vision to what was originally viewed as normal for design in terms of skins for players. While we, the players, are not able to create our own skins in this new “model” nature, we can enjoy the freedom of knowing there are plenty of skins with these specific concepts of design implemented.</p><h2 id="The-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#The-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="The Pros and Cons"></a>The Pros and Cons</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6T6cL28OPsm_1U5VPkd6PBwgMIE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/headless-haunter-580590743df78cbc2843ddb2.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Minecraft &#x2F; Mojang</p><p> There are two sides to every coin and everybody prefers one. Someone might save that coin, while another person may spend it as soon as they get the chance. Sadly, this is where that coin comes into play. If you’ve played “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-minecraft-2363311" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “ since its original release, you may wonder why a person would pay money for skins. If you’ve recently joined in on the craze, you’d probably wonder how a person doesn’t. For players of the PC (non-Windows 10) Edition of the game, you may look at these skins as a quick cash grab by Mojang and Microsoft, while players who originally started playing on the other editions of the game may look at this as the regular.</p><p> Players are allowed to upload their own skins to the Pocket Edition and Windows 10 Edition of the game, however, they are not able to use the skins from the various packs available. When uploading your own skin to Pocket or Windows 10 Edition, you are stuck with the original look of the PC “Minecraft” skins, unable to have added in features like the “Farlander” skin. While these “features” do nothing to aid the player and are purely cosmetic, some people find these cosmetic overrides to be worth it.</p><p> Whoever purchases these skins gets the option to wear sixteen different costumes throughout their “Minecraft” adventure. Whether or not you want to shell out that much money, design your own, or use one of the pre-created skins that are available to use in the game, that is up to you.</p><p> Aside from the cost of the skin being the one negative, there are loads of positives. The designs are wonderful and fit with the Halloween season, the price isn’t as high as it honestly could be, and the diversity of characters are sure to make you learn everything about their appearance.</p><h2 id="Personal-Preference"><a href="#Personal-Preference" class="headerlink" title="Personal Preference"></a>Personal Preference</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kTjWZONU4iWrxUPn3I5oAzkumkE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/farlander-5805908a3df78cbc2843de47.png"                      alt="Minecraft Skins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Minecraft &#x2F; Mojang</p><p> In my honest opinion, what makes this skin pack worth the small charge is a very select few of the skins within. The Farlander skin, the Rancid Anne skin, and The Sea-Swallowed Captain skin are easily my favorites out of the bunch of sixteen. These four skins are enough for me to purchase and use throughout my adventure in “Minecraft’s” Windows 10 Edition or the “Pocket Edition” game.</p><p> The Farlander skin has a very intriguing appearance with the floating blocks around its body. With its vague features, yet human appearance, players can either interpret this skin as either a boy or a girl. While players shouldn’t feel constricted to stick with a skin that looks like it is specifically one gender or the other, the fact that the Farlanders skin could be examined and interpreted as either is a nice touch (intentional or not).</p><p> While she’s definitely not a Raggedy Anne, she sure does smell bad. Rancid Anne 403 has a zombie-ish appearance, clearly depicted in mid-transformation. Mojang took it upon themselves to take advantage of the new models to push a zombified skin inside the original, allowing them to give a zombified appearance when removing a few pixels from the main “Anne” body parts.</p><p> Cropsy’s skin is of a very interesting design. While it may appear to be just a regular scarecrow, it’s actually alive! This skin dons a watermelon, rather than featuring the traditional pumpkin you would find on any other scarecrow’s head. On top of that, utilizing the new models, Mojang also placed a bright purple hat on his head, along with what appears to be a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/minecraft-mobs-explained-villagers-2363338" >Villager’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nose that has been colored green. This addition makes him much more lively, especially with the haunting face that has been cut out.</p><p> The Sea-Swallowed Captain makes his very blue debut in this skin pack, showcasing many of his interesting features. With his hook for a hand, a peg leg, his missing teeth, a pirate hat, and his deep blue skin, it’d be very hard to miss him in a crowd. Out of the bunch, his skin is arguably the most detailed. The colors, layers, carefully detailed body parts, and outright originality used to create this character bring many new possibilities for designing<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/minecraft-mobs-explained-creepers-2363323" >mobs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and entities for “Minecraft.”</p><p> While there are other honorable mentions that were very close to making it to my top four skins within this pack, these are the ones I felt deserved the most recognition out of the bunch.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115951/19272" target="_top" id="2115951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115951/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="In-Conclusion"><a href="#In-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In Conclusion"></a>In Conclusion</h2><p> Whether or not you’d like to pay approximately a small charge on a handful of skins is your prerogative. If you feel you can better create or find a design for free online, you should honestly probably try to. While a small charge may not seem like a lot, it’s still money that you could spend on something else given the opportunity. You may purchase this pack of skins, think you want to use one, and never look at them again.</p><p> Think about it and decide later. If you know you are wanting these skins, they are definitely great and worth the two dollars (if you decide to actually use them).</p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-repairing-an-inoperative-obs-video-feed/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Repairing an Inoperative OBS Video Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-lightning-fast-windowed-gallery-viewer-alert/"><u>[New] Lightning-Fast Windowed Gallery Viewer Alert</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-budget-friendly-video-recording-tools-for-pcs/"><u>[Updated] Budget-Friendly Video Recording Tools for PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harnessing-the-hype-how-to-hike-your-youtube-horde/"><u>2024 Approved Harnessing the Hype How to Hike Your Youtube Horde</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/embracing-change-discover-what-makes-me-cherish-this-newly-launched-gaming-controller/"><u>Embracing Change: Discover What Makes Me Cherish This Newly Launched Gaming Controller</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/embracing-strategy-why-classic-turn-based-titles-like-chess-and-baldurs-gate-lete-gaming/"><u>Embracing Strategy: Why Classic Turn-Based Titles Like Chess and Baldur's Gate Lete Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/enjoy-streaming-on-the-go-with-verizons-latest-package-no-more-ads-includes-netflix-and-amcplus/"><u>Enjoy Streaming on the Go with Verizon's Latest Package: No More Ads, Includes Netflix & AMC+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/exclusive-offer-alert-score-20-off-on-plexs-unlimited-subscription-limited-time-only/"><u>Exclusive Offer Alert: Score 20% Off on Plex's Unlimited Subscription - Limited Time Only!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-iphone-se-could-not-be-activatedreached-issue-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Fix iPhone SE Could Not Be Activated/Reached Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-premiere-pros-art-of-audio-transitioning/"><u>In 2024, Premiere Pro’s Art of Audio Transitioning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/the-essential-guide-to-crafting-dynamic-snaps/"><u>The Essential Guide to Crafting Dynamic Snaps</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959764/19272" target="_top" id="1959764">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959764" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959764/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner.

Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.
