###  UPDATE: 07/12/23

 Prime Day is winding down---it's your last chance to get these discounts!

[Amazon Prime Day 2023](https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU227817&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F903344%2Famazon-prime-day-2023-deals%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is live! Taking place on July 11 and 12, Prime Day aims to offer customers with some of the best sales, lightning deals, and more of the year. But, that is a lot to look through, and many don't have the time to scour the massive sales page to find the products they want to spend their hard-earned cash on.

 That's where we come in. Our curated Prime Day deals roundup picks out some of the best deals available, so you don't need to dig through it all yourself. That's not all, though---you can also subscribe to the [How-To Geek Deals newsletter](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/optimal-sound-systems-under-100-for-immersive-gameplay-for-2024/) for even more deals year round!

 Just remember, to take advantage of some of these deals, you need Amazon Prime. If you need a subscription, we have some ways to [grab Prime for cheap](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-leading-ios-emulators-virtual-ps2-world/).

 While we'll check and update this list throughout Prime Day, some deals may sell out or expire between updates. We'll remove those expired deals as we see them and add new ones, so keep checking throughout the event for the most up-to-date sales!

 We can always use more storage. Even if you think you have enough, it's always best to have more than you think you need---you never know when you suddenly need to download a bunch of 4K videos or back up a failing drive.
