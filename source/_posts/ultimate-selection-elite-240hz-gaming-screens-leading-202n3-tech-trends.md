##  What to Look For in a 240HZ Gaming Monitor in 2023

 While shopping for a 240Hz monitor, it’s most important to consider your gaming setup. If you have a top-end PC with one of the best gaming GPUs that can drive high frame rates at high resolutions, you can consider [a 1440p or 4K monitor](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/onscreen-excellence-flexible-talent-access/). But if your PC has a mid-range or low-end graphics card, you are better off going for a full-HD monitor to enjoy the highest refresh rate. Otherwise, you won't get the most out of your 240Hz monitor.

 Input lag is another critical aspect of any gaming monitor purchase. You want low input lag. Typically, under 10ms input lag is considered the best in the business, but unless you are a competitive gamer, under 20ms is also good enough for most people. Your budget will also play a significant role while shopping for monitors. Fortunately, you can find 240Hz monitors at a variety of price points.

 It’s also a good idea to consider the display technology in your prospective gaming monitor. While [OLED displays](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) produce inky blacks and have the best response time, they are susceptible to permanent image retention. On the other hand, [IPS LCD displays](https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-great-debate-final-cut-pro-vs-lumafusion-for-video-editing/) have superb color accuracy and wide viewing angles but have a mediocre [contrast ratio](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-ledger-unveiling-the-best-text-generation-apps/). Similarly, VA-type LCD panels have a good contrast ratio but narrow viewing angles.

 Lastly, VRR support, stand ergonomics, and input port selection are some other features to watch out for while shopping.

Dell

| Pros                                       | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Support overclocking refresh rate to 280Hz | Mediocre contrast ratio |
| Low input lag and fast response time       | No USB-C port           |
| Excellent ergonomics                       |                         |

 The [Dell Alienware AW2723DF](https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW2723DF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability/dp/B0BCXJ7XXM/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001008&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-240hz-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best 240Hz gaming monitor for most people. It has a reasonable [1440p resolution](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-binge-worthy-music-reaction-videos-on-youtube/) and a 27-inch screen size. So you get a crisp image and plenty of screen real estate to enjoy an immersive gaming experience. It also uses an IPS panel for excellent color accuracy, but the black levels and the contrast ratio are mediocre, which is expected. If these two things matter a lot to you, you should opt for an OLED option.

 Otherwise, the AW2723DF delivers a fantastic gaming performance with low input lag and a fast response time. While the native refresh rate of the panel is 240Hz, you can overclock it to 280Hz. Additionally, the display supports [AMD FreeSync](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/) and [NVIDIA G-Sync](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/winchatgpt-setup-guide/) to reduce [screen tearing](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-preloaded-features-of-chatgpt-functions-and-implementation-tips/).

 Among other features, the Dell offering is [DisplayHDR 600](https://common-error.techidaily.com/comprehensive-solution-for-dealing-with-failed-attempts-at-accessing-a-remote-server/) certified. It can reach up to 700 nits of peak brightness to provide a satisfying HDR experience in gaming and media consumption.

 As Alienware is Dell’s gaming-focused brand, the AW2723DF has a gamer-oriented design and RGB lighting on the back. It’s also very ergonomic; you can adjust it to get the perfect viewing angle and positioning. Plus, there is VESA mounting support.

 In terms of the inputs, you get two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DP 1.4, two 3.5mm audio out ports, and four USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports. Unfortunately, there is no USB Type-C port. Lastly, gamers will enjoy the extra features like virtual crosshair, console mode, and frame rate counter.

| Pros                                           | Cons                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Attractive pricing                             | Poor local dimming implementation |
| Support for AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync VRR | Doesn’t support swivel adjustment |
| Low input lag                                  |                                   |

 If you have a limited budget for your monitor purchase, the [HP Omen 27qs](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-omen-27-ips-led-qhd-240hz-freesync-and-g-sync-compatible-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-displayport-hdmi-usb-black%2F6536814.p) is the display to have on your shortlist. Despite its affordable pricing, it packs a 1440p resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate. Games feel responsive thanks to its impressively low input lag and smooth motion. There is also support for AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync VRR technologies.

 The Omen 27qs can also display virtual crosshair and the current frame rate among gaming-related enhancements. Plus, there are two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DP 1.4, and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports.

 The picture quality is good, and the presence of an IPS panel results in accurate colors and wide viewing angles. The 27qs also get bright enough in both SDR and HDR. But, while it has a decent HDR brightness, it doesn’t [deliver a solid HDR experience](https://reviewed.usatoday.com/gaming/content/hp-omen-27q-review) because of its poor contrast ratio, resulting from its disappointing local dimming implementation. You can’t even disable it if you want. But all this is just part and parcel of buying a budget monitor. Additionally, while the included stand is relatively ergonomic, it doesn’t support swivel adjustment.

| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outstanding picture quality            | Aggressive 800R curvature may take a little getting used to |
| Low input lag and a fast response time | Susceptible to burn-in                                      |
| Two HDMI 2.1 ports                     |                                                             |

 There aren’t many ultrawide monitors that offer a 240Hz refresh rate, but despite the limited choice, you have a fantastic option in the [LG 45GR95QE-B](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2001008%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-45gr95qe-b-gaming-monitor). It’s a 45-inch curved OLED monitor with a 3440 x 1440p resolution.

 Thanks to its OLED panel, the monitor can produce inky blacks and has a near-infinite contrast ratio, resulting in punchy and vibrant colors. The overall picture quality is outstanding. Another benefit of having an OLED panel is the superb response time, so you won’t notice any motion artifacts.

 Like our other recommendations, the 45GR95QE-B also has a low input lag, resulting in a responsive gaming experience. You also get support for AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync VRR.

 The monitor looks good and has excellent build quality. You also get two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DP 1.4, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, and a 3.5mm audio out. Plus, you can access the virtual crosshair and FPS counter on the monitor.

 Even beyond gaming, the LG offering is excellent for everything from office work to watching your favorite movies or TV shows.

 One of the issues some people may find with the LG 45GR95QE-B is the aggressive 800R curvature. Additionally, being an OLED monitor, it’s susceptible to [burn-in](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-virtual-arena-transcript/). So you’ll need to be careful and take a few precautions. But it’s not a deal breaker.

| Pros                                   | Cons                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fantastic picture quality              | Susceptible to burn-in                    |
| AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync support | HDMI 2.1 port limited to 24Gbps bandwidth |
| HDMI 2.1, DP 1.4, and USB-C ports      | Relatively lower brightness in SDR        |

 While our best overall pick—the [Dell Alienware AW2327DF](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2001008%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Falienware-27-gaming-monitor-aw2723df%2Fapd%2F210-bfek%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories)—is an excellent 240Hz monitor, the [Corsair Xeneon 27QHD240](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-XENEON-27QHD240-27-Inch-Monitor/dp/B0C3SFTL1X/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001008&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-240hz-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a solid alternative if you prefer an OLED screen. It’s a 27-inch 1440p monitor that excels in almost every aspect, but gaming is undoubtedly its strong suit.

 As is typical for OLED monitors, it produces inky blacks, has wide viewing angles, and offers an impressive response time. It also has a low input lag at higher refresh rates, but the lag increases at lower frame rates. While competitive gamers may find an issue, the lag is low enough for most people.

 Support for both major VRR technologies is present to reduce screen tearing, and it also supports low framerate compensation to deliver a good experience even when the refresh rate drops below 20Hz.

 Moreover, you get two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DP 1.4 port, four USB Type-A ports, and two USB-C ports. All USB ports have USB 3.2 Gen 1 speeds, but the Type-C ports also support 65W USB Power Delivery to charge your laptop, tablet, or phone. Another plus point of the monitor is the built-in [KVM switch](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ispoofer-is-not-working-on-nokia-c300-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 Unfortunately, the Xeneon 27QHD240, like other OLED displays, is susceptible to burn-in. But you will be happy to know the company [offers a three-year warranty](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/gamer/monitors/should-i-be-concerned-about-burn-in-on-my-corsair-oled-monitor/) for any burn-in as long as you use the built-in orbit and image retention refresh options on your monitor.

 The only other drawback to the Corsair offering is its [relatively low brightness in the SDR mode](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/corsair/xeneon-27qhd240), which leaves it vulnerable to glare in high-brightness environments.

| Pros                                              | Cons                             |

| Curved screen provides an immersive experience    |                                  |

 If you have a high-end gaming PC and want to get the most out of it, the [Samsung Odyssey Neo G8](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-FreeSync-Ultrawide-DisplayPort/dp/B09ZH3WM47/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001008&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-240hz-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is perfect with its [4K resolution](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/), 32-inch display size, and 240Hz refresh rate. It’s also curved with a [1000R radius](https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-power-of-creativity-magix-video-pro-x-demystified/), providing an immersive experience.

 As the monitor uses a VA-type LCD panel with Mini-LED backlighting and [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/), you get a fantastic contrast ratio and high [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/). Another positive of the Samsung offering is the incredibly low input lag for a responsive experience. You also get a fast response time.

 Port selection is solid with two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4, and two USB Type-A ports rated at USB 3.2 Gen 1 speeds. And despite its curved nature and relatively larger size, the Neo G8 has excellent ergonomics. It offers everything from height to swivel adjustments.

 In other highlights, the Samsung offering is great for watching media, getting some work done, and pretty much anything else.

 Although there is much to like about the Odyssey Neo G8, it’s not perfect. You may encounter [some flickering issues](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/odyssey-neo-g8-s32bg85) at low frame rates. Also, only the top-end PCs will take full advantage of this monitor.

### Is a 240Hz monitor worth it?

 If your gaming PC can drive 240fps in your favorite games, a [240Hz monitor can be worth it](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-snapchat-snaps-with-customizable-user-voices/). You will experience fluid gaming, and even general computer usage will feel smoother. It’s also a good idea if you plan to keep your monitor for a long time. Plus, for competitive gamers, it’s a no-brainer. But if you have a mid-range PC or play titles on which even the highest-end PC can’t drive 240fps, it’s better to stick with a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor.

### Can the human eye perceive 240Hz?

 The human eye can perceive a 240Hz refresh rate. While the ability to perceive varies from person to person, [a study has shown](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-perfecting-video-cuts-the-role-of-visual-callouts-in-edits/) humans can see up to 500Hz refresh rate under the right conditions. Frequent exposure to high refresh rate content also increases a person’s ability to notice higher refresh rates. As a result, gamers are often most attuned to notice 240Hz and higher refresh rates.

### How can I tell if my GPU can run games at 240Hz?

 A GPU’s ability to run games depends on multiple factors, including the game’s visual complexity and the display resolution. So, there is no cut-and-dry way to determine whether your GPU can run games at 240Hz. So, it’s a good idea to check media and user reviews to find out whether your GPU can drive your favorite games at the resolution you want.

### Will a 240Hz monitor increase FPS?

 A monitor can only display the frames generated by your computer’s GPU. So, it can’t increase the FPS count on its own. But if your GPU can generate 240 fps, you will see all the frames on your 240Hz monitor.
