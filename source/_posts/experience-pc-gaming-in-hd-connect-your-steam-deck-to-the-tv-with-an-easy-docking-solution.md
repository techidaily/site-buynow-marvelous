## Experience PC Gaming in HD: Connect Your Steam Deck to the TV with an Easy Docking Solution

Take some time away from your PC with a Steam Deck dock, and enjoy some great games on the big screen.

 Picture this—it's the end of a long work day. You log off after staring at your computer screen for eight hours, and now you want to relax with some gaming. So you sit back down at the computer you were just at and boot something up.

 But wouldn't it be nice to get away from the computer for a bit? Maybe play your PC games on that big-screen TV instead? If you have a [Steam Deck](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-vivo-x100-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), there's a great solution for you—a [Steam Deck dock](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-beginners-guide-how-to-create-a-youtube-channel-and-make-money/). Like a [Nintendo Switch dock](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hook-creating-headline-helper/), you can pop your Steam Deck (and, for many options, your [ASUS ROG Ally](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-and-shine-the-top-5-video-quality-tools/)) onto it and enjoy big-screen gaming without fuss. No need to hardwire your tower to your TV, or deal with possibly laggy cloud services. Just plug everything in and go!

 While Valve has released an [official Steam Deck dock](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock) for $79, it's a bit expensive. Instead, it's better to look at third-party options, which are cheaper and have the same features (and sometimes more). One such dock is the [Anker Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CS6BWL4Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003865&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplay-pc-games-on-the-big-screen-with-a-steam-deck-dock%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), which gives you everything you need to get your Steam Deck or ROG Ally up and running on your TV.

 This docking station comes with everything you need to hook up your portable console, including a 4K HDMI output, an Ethernet port to connect your Steam Deck to the internet, and USB-A ports to plug in controllers or whatever else you may need. Best of all, you can pick this dock up for $39.09, 15% off the full price. There's no need to wait for [Prime Day](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-6-plus-passcode-screen-by-drfone-ios/) for this deal!

 If you think a Steam Deck dock is a bit much, you can also opt for a [USB-C hub](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-joint-venture-campaigns-for-brands-on-video-platforms/), which is a bit more versatile. You'll lose the ability to prop your portable up, but you'll also be able to use it with your laptop or PC easily. It may be a worthwhile trade-off for you!
