##  What to Look For in a Smart Plug

 Most [smart plugs](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-htc-u23-to-other-android-devices-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) have the same general capabilities. They're able to open or block the flow of electricity to turn appliances on and off. However, this only works if an appliance has a power switch that can be "On."

 In other words, if your appliance can turn on after plugging it into an outlet, it'll work with smart plugs. If you need to press a button after plugging in an appliance to turn it on, it won't work with a smart plug. Keep this in mind before shopping for any plug.

 Smart plugs can connect to various smart assistants such as Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, HomeKit, and IFTTT. This allows you to control them with the respective voice assistant, usually through the app and by voice.

 So, if you have an Echo smart speaker and want to make the most of your smart plug, look for one that supports Alexa. The same goes for other voice assistants. Smart plugs usually can work with all ecosystems, but there are exceptions!

 The size of smart plugs is another important factor to consider. Some are incredibly bulky and can take up multiple AC power sockets that are next to each other. Remember that just because a smart plug is bigger doesn't mean it'll provide additional features or perform better.

 The last thing to note is that smart plugs are essentially the same thing as smart outlets. The main difference is that smart outlets are bigger, which usually provides more sockets for you to plug in numerous appliances.

 Let's take a closer look at some of the best smart plugs on the market.

| Pros                                           | Cons                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Monitors energy consumption                  | ✗ Requires a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network         |
| ✓ Works well with many third-party devices     | ✗ Doesn't support Apple's Siri or HomeKit |
| ✓ Affordable                                   |                                           |
| ✓ Offers Away mode to scare off strangers      |                                           |
| ✓ Great integration with Google Nest and Alexa |                                           |

 The [Kasa Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-HS103P2-Required-Google-Assistant/dp/B07B8W2KHZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) makes the top of our list because it pairs seamlessly with Google Assistant, Alexa, and IFTTT, so it's a fantastic smart plug for most people. Apple HomeKit users will have to get a [smart plug designed for their smart home ecosystem](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-insights-into-instagram-an-in-depth-analysis-guide-for-professionals/), but for everyone else, Kasa's plug is a perfect fit.

 Once you set up the plug, you can control it all in the [Kasa app](https://www.kasasmart.com/us). There, you can set timers, create schedules, turn the plug on and off, turn on Away mode to make your home look occupied, and monitor run times and usage. You can also use voice commands with Alexa or Google Assistant to control the plug.

 Although this smart plug needs to connect to a [2.4GHz](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-android-without-a-wire-heres-your-free-games-list-for-2024/) Wi-Fi signal, it works well with many third-party devices, including other Kasa products. You won't need to worry about compatibility here.

 Finally, like most of our recommendations, the Kasa smart plug has a rectangular build to save on space. This one won't take up an extra outlet by being too big!

 The $20 set comes with two plugs, but you can get the [three-pack for $25.](https://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-HS103P2-Required-Google-Assistant/dp/B07S57PQSM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) The three-pack is the best value if you're looking to deck out your home with smart home technology.

| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✓ No need to install a third-party app       | ✗ Requires a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network         |
| ✓ Offers strong performance and connectivity | ✗ Requires Alexa or Google Assistant      |
| ✓ Fast and easy set up                       | ✗ Doesn't support Apple's Siri or HomeKit |
| ✓ Same capabilities as more expensive plugs  |                                           |

 Looking for a cheap smart plug that can do the job? [BroadLink's smart plug](https://www.amazon.com/BroadLink-Version-Required-Control-Anywhere/dp/B08732M6TG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) costs just $8 for one, but you can get [three for $17](https://www.amazon.com/BroadLink-Version-Required-Control-Anywhere/dp/B08731VW4R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or [five for $28](https://www.amazon.com/BroadLink-Version-Required-Control-Anywhere/dp/B08732L8MQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). We recommend going for the three-pack as you're almost getting one for free.

 We chose this as the best budget option for several reasons. For starters, it's definitely one of the least expensive smart plugs on the market, while still providing great value. The plug requires you to have Alexa- or Google Assistant-powered devices, and it also works with IFTTT.

 There's no third-party app to download, so you need to connect it to a voice assistant, but there's a good chance you're using one of those anyway if you're decking out a smart home.

 Once connected, you can control the plug by voice, set timers, and create schedules. There's even an Away mode, which turns on the plug at random times to make it seem like you're at home. The plug uses a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signal, and it has a rectangular build. You can conveniently stack three of these on top of each other, so you can use them in standard outlets easily.

Best Budget Smart Plug

#####  BroadLink Smart Plug

Just need a budget smart plug that gets the job done? BreadLink's got you covered, provided you don't need a plug that works with HomeKit.

[$8 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/BroadLink-Version-Required-Control-Anywhere/dp/B08732M6TG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

##  Best Outdoor Smart Plug: [meross Outdoor Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/meross-Outdoor-Waterproof-SmartThings-Schedule/dp/B0BJDQ3PPS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                                            | Cons                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✓ Works with HomeKit, Alexa, and SmartThings    | ✗ Main power cord is a little short |
| ✓ Smart outlets can be controlled independently |                                     |
| ✓ Weatherproof protection                       |                                     |

 If you're looking to get things sorted for your outdoor space, the [meross Outdoor Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/meross-Outdoor-Waterproof-SmartThings-Schedule/dp/B0BJDQ3PPS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) makes an excellent choice. This dual outlet smart plug has an IP44 waterproof rating and works with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and SmartThings for convenient hands-free voice control. 

 As well as being waterproof, it has a dustproof and fireproof casing, offering solid all-round protection against the elements. It features a handy hang buckle, so it can be mounted flush against an outside wall, garage, or in your basement—anywhere where your home Wi-Fi might need a boost. 

 With the meross app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209440/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meross.meross&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/meross/id1260842951), you can control both outlets independently, setting schedules and timers for your attached devices. You'll need to use a [HomePod](https://www.apple.com/homepod/) to enable HomeKit control, but otherwise, installation is a relatively simple affair, no matter what smart home ecosystem you use. 

 The power cord itself measures 7.5 inches, which is not particularly generous, and is one thing to bear in mind if you're considering investing in this smart plug. However, provided you have a suitable outlet near your desired location, this can work in its favor, as it reduces cable clutter and the chances of tripping over an excess of cord length. 

 Ideal for installing outdoor smart lighting, sprinkler systems, or even a projector for movie nights, the meross outdoor smart plug offers a versatile solution for smart control of your outdoor appliances.

| Pros                                            | Cons                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✓ Great compatibility with Amazon Alexa devices | ✗ A little pricey                                      |
| ✓ Fast setup in the Alexa app                   | ✗ Doesn't support any other voice assistant than Alexa |
| ✓ High-performance and strong connectivity      | ✗ Requires a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network                      |

 If you're wondering what the best smart plug is for your Alexa smart speaker or smart display, it's probably [the one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-smart-plug-works-with-Alexa/dp/B089DR29T6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Amazon's known to make some of the most popular smart home technology today, such as the [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). With its [$25 smart plug](https://www.reviewgeek.com/139605/amazon-smart-plug-review/), you'll have an easy time connecting it to your Alexa-powered smart home.

 The plug works exclusively with Alexa---[Google Assistant](https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-infusing-interactive-elements-incorrante-youtube-music-into-videography-for-2024/), IFTTT, and [Apple HomeKit](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-insights-into-instagram-an-in-depth-analysis-guide-for-professionals/) users will have to look for another plug. Through the Alexa app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU209440/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-alexa/id944011620), you can set up the Amazon Smart Plug easily and have control of all of this plug's features, including voice control, scheduling, and controlling the power. However, you'll need to connect the plug to a [2.4GHz Wi-Fi network](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-android-without-a-wire-heres-your-free-games-list-for-2024/), so you can't just configure it with Alexa and call it a day.

 With the Amazon Smart Plug, you can create [Alexa Routines](https://techidaily.com/undelete-lost-messages-from-galaxy-s24-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/) seamlessly, making it the perfect plug for those with an Alexa ecosystem. The Amazon Smart Plug also has a space-saving rectangular build best suited for outlets with vertically stacked sockets.

| ✓ Cross-platform versatility with Matter        | ✗ Expensive                               |
| ✓ Great for protecting personal data            | ✗ Requires a hub for your chosen platform |

| ✓ Energy consumption tracking for HomeKit users |                                           |

 The [Eve Energy (Matter) Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Energy-Matter-Control-SmartThings/dp/B0BZBGD87V?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209440&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F739326%2Fbest-smart-plugs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent (albeit rather expensive) option if you want a smart plug that works with Apple HomeKit. It also works with Alexa, Google Home, and SmartThings, offering voice assistant control for a broad range of smart home integrations. 

 Plus, as this is a Matter-enabled smart plug, the good news is that it allows cross-platform control for different phones and smart assistants, so you don't need to worry about compatibility. You just need to ensure that you have a hub installed for your chosen platform, and you're good to go. 

 Setup is quick and easy, using your preferred platform's app or voice assistant, and you can enjoy complete freedom to set custom schedules for your attached devices or appliances. And for the security-conscious among you, the Eve Energy (Matter) Smart Plug offers 100% privacy, with no Eve cloud or bridge, and no registration or tracking, either. 

 Naturally, you'll pay a premium for this security, and this is the only real sticking point with this remarkable smart plug. At just under $40 for a single outlet plug, it's certainly not the cheapest option for decking out your whole home. 

 However, this is still a powerhouse among smart plugs. Cross-platform convenience, data security, and all the customization options you can shake a stick at. Plus, for HomeKit users, the Eve app lets you track your energy consumption too, giving you valuable insights that could help you move towards a more energy-efficient home.

### What are smart plugs?

 A smart plug is a small power adapter inserted between an appliance and your electrical outlet. They are Wi-Fi-enabled, so power to the connected appliance can be controlled remotely from a mobile device or by using a voice assistant such as Siri or Alexa.

 Insert the plug into the electrical outlet and check that it is powered on. Open the companion app for the smart plug on your phone or tablet, and follow the instructions to find and connect the plug to your Wi-Fi network.

### Do smart plugs save energy?

 There are numerous ways smart plugs can be used to save energy and help reduce your bills. You can use them to automatically turn off [energy vampires](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-photos-files-from-realme-gt-5-240w-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/) overnight or to turn off lights remotely that you forgot to kill before you left home. Some even have built-in energy monitors to help you better understand your biggest energy drains.
