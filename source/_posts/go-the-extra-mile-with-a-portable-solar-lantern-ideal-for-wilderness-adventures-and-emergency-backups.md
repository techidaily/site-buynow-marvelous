## Go the Extra Mile with a Portable Solar Lantern – Ideal for Wilderness Adventures & Emergency Backups

### Key Takeaways

* Luci Lanterns are compact, solar-powered, and versatile for camping, emergencies, or power outages.
* Charge the Luci light with sunlight or USB-C for long-lasting brightness indoors or outdoors.
* Affordable and effective, the MPOWERD Luci lantern is great for those who enjoy the outdoors or live in areas prone to power outages.

 All it takes is one extended power outage or a camping trip without a portable charger to realize having backup gear is pretty important. This week, I was reminded of that due to continuous power outages in Texas. Thankfully, I had my favorite trusty portable solar LED lantern to light up the dark.

 Depending on where you live, power outages can be a fairly common inconvenience. Sure, we all have a flashlight on our phones, but I typically want several different light sources ready to go. Furthermore, I don't want to buy a big lantern that'll take up space in my garage that only gets used once a year. Here's what I use instead and why you'll want one too.

##  The Luci Lantern

 I've opted for several collapsible and portable solar-powered LED lanterns. These take up hardly any space on garage shelves or closets in the house, have plenty of battery life, and charge over USB-C or from a bit of sunshine. I'm talking about the [MPOWERD Luci Solar Inflatable lantern for around $20.](https://www.amazon.com/MPOWERD-Luci-Outdoor-2-0-Rechargeable/dp/B0BX2GN4KL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004131&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsolar-lantern-perfect-for-camping-or-power-outages%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 The Luci light is a small, durable, unassuming little light with plenty to offer. It's advertised as an outdoor light, but I use them everywhere. In fact, I own like five of these in a few different colors and models, including one that's 6–7 years old, and use all of them both indoors and during outdoor adventures.

 What makes the Luci solar lights so wonderful is their design and ease of use. They're compact but inflate like a pool floatie and have a row of bright LEDs that'll be enough for any campsite, tent, or living room. Charge it with sunlight during adventures or a power outage before the sun goes down, and it'll last all night. And if you don't have time to get Sun rays, you can charge or power it from the USB-C port. You can adjust the brightness levels or turn on an SOS mode that blinks. 

 When the power went out at my house this week, I found two of these in the closet, and I have no clue when I last charged them. Thankfully, there was plenty of juice and it gave us light for hours. I grabbed two more from my camping gear in the garage and put them throughout the house. What a perfect yet simple solution.

 Don't get me wrong. I also have the [Anker 767 power station](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-infinix-hot-40-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/) to run my Fridge or lights and [other gear to survive off-grid](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enable-vlcs-webcam-recording-for-high-quality-footage/), but when you just need to make it through a few hours without power, these Luci lights come in handy. The [Goal Zero Crush Light](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Zero-Crush-Powered-Lantern/dp/B07BMJPH8L/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004131&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsolar-lantern-perfect-for-camping-or-power-outages%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a good option as well.

 I bought Luci lanterns for camping trips. I usually throw a few on the dash while driving to the destination, and that's all it takes to get a full charge. That way, I have lights for the entire weekend. However, after living in Texas for the last 18 months, I've come to realize how great they are inside, too.

 The MPOWERD Luci light is affordable, bright, effective, and useful in various situations. If you enjoy the rugged outdoors or live somewhere with rolling blackouts, this dual-purpose light is an excellent little gadget to have.
