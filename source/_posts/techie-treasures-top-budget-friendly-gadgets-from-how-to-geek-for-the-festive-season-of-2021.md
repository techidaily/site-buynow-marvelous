##  Tamagotchi Pix: A Pet With No Mess

![child using Tamagotchi Pix](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tamagotchi.jpg) 

Tamagotchi

 Looking after a pet can be a lot of work. While the companionship is nice, the time required to look after a pet properly really adds up, and you should never buy someone a surprise pet as a gift.

 On the other hand, you can definitely buy someone the [Tamagotchi Pix](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XWNLV1S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) because a digital pet doesn't need as much attention. Tamagotchis have been a part of tech gifts for decades now, and the latest models include color screens, the ability to take selfies with their pet, and even plenty of games to play too.

 This toy should make kids, or adults who remember Tamagotchis fondly, really happy.

##  Mario Kart Live: Augmented Reality Kart Racing

![Mario Kart Live kart on ground](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mario-kart-live-circuit.jpg)

Nintendo

 An important note when it comes to this gift: Whoever you're looking to buy for will need a [Nintendo Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Gray-Joy%E2%80%91-HAC-001/dp/B07VJRZ62R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) to use it. [Mario Kart Live](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H9KGMWK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is not a standalone game!

 Mario Kart Live brings the fantastic cart racer into the real world. It sounds utterly absurd, but it works surprisingly well. The player gets to control a real Mario Kart around a course they build in their own home using special gates. Then, the track can be played in real-time via [augmented reality](https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-your-entertainment-perfecting-the-art-of-using-netflixs-floating-window-feature/) using the Switch.

 The AR game can even be played in multiplayer, although each player will need their own copy of the game and Switch. If that sounds a little too expensive, you can also go with buying them a copy of [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe](https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1037CV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) for a more accessible multiplayer.

#####  Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit

Sony

 This one's a gift for the older gamer. It's for those who miss the days when game graphics were sharp and pointy. It can also be an excellent gift for younger gamers if they're interested in the retro scene.

 The [PlayStation Classic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HHVF2XG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a neat little device that houses twenty classic games from the original PlayStation. That means it brings with it powerhouses like Final Fantasy 7 and Ridge Racer Type 4\. It also comes with two controllers so more people can enjoy the multiplayer titles.

 Sony's replica console is notably smaller than the original console, which is adorable and a space saver.

![instax mini instant camera on pink background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instax-mini-11.jpg) 

Instax

 Have you got someone in your life that adores taking pictures? If that's the case, you should consider getting them the [Instax Mini 11 Instant Film Camera](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ffujifilm-instax-mini-11-instant-film-camera-sky-blue%2F6400595.p%3FskuId%3D6400595).

 This cute little physical camera automatically selects the correct exposure level for whatever environment it's used in---something generally reserved for smartphone cameras. It also comes with a selfie mode, making it easier to take pictures of everyone, no matter the setting.

 On top of that, it's small, easy to use, and instantly prints physical photos from the top of the camera. Many people miss the novelty of physical photographs and having one printed immediately after a shot is sure to please.

 The Instax Mini will not replace a more expensive camera, but it's quirky and a lot easier to carry around. You can buy some [extra film](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ffujifilm-instax-mini-instant-color-film-twin-pack%2F2015049.p%3FskuId%3D2015049) as an added gift too.

##  Ember Smart Mug: Keep that Coffee Hot

![person controlling ember mug temperature](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ember-mug.jpg) 

Ember

 Many people love a good cup of coffee, but they also get distracted after making it, and the coffee gets cold. There's not a lot of people out there that enjoy cold coffee.

 If you know someone like this, then the [Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug 2](https://www.amazon.com/Ember-Black-Ceramic-Mug-Gen/dp/B07NQRM6ML?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is the perfect gift for them. This 10 oz black mug is an [app-controlled](https://support.ember.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003805011-App-Where-to-download-the-Ember-App) heating device. The smart mug allows your giftee to control the exact temperature of their drink. It'll never be too hot or too cold in the Ember mug.

 Used on its own, the smart mug has a 1.5-hour battery life. But, on the charging coaster, it can last as long as is needed. The Ember Smart Mug might seem like an extraneous gift, but it's very practical, and we think there's a good chance your recipient will use and love it.

## Echo Devices: Amazon's Smart Speaker and Screen

![An Amazon Echo Show on a table.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/echo-show-5.jpg) 

Amazon

 If the person you're buying for is keen on starting a smart home but hasn't yet made the leap, you can help them out with some Amazon Echo products.

 The [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is an impressive smart speaker that offers excellent sound when playing music. Not only that, but it can also act as the central smart home hub for helping people to control whatever other smart devices they have, providing they're Alexa-compatible. Thankfully, most major companies and devices can be used with Alexa, so giftees can mix and match as needed.

 There's also the [Amazon Echo Show 5](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761188%2Fbest-gifts-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The Show 5 is a powerful smart display that comes with a 2-megapixel camera, which can be also be used to look through whatever smart cameras around the house. Of course, the smart display can also be used to play music or watch movies.

 One of these devices, or both of them together, can help bring them into the smart home future.

##  Nest Devices: Google's Smart Devices

![Google Nest Hub on nightstand](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-nest-hub.jpg) 

Google

 There are different smart home ecosystems available, and which items and apps are compatible depends on the hub someone has. If your giftee enjoys Google devices, then you'll want to buy them Nest smart home products.

[Nest Audio](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest%5Faudio?hl=en-US) is Google's version of the smart speaker. It can be controlled via voice, has an impressive speaker, and can also be used to control lights, TVs, and anything else that's compatible too. The Nest Audio can also be used as a hub to control other smart home devices.

 The [Nest Hub](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnest-hub-smart-display-with-google-assistant-2nd-gen-charcoal%2F6450818.p%3FskuId%3D6450818) can be used to watch videos, make video calls, and even as a way to wake up in the morning. Both the Hub and Audio devices can communicate with one another too, which means the owner can listen to music or podcasts as they move through their house.

 Whether you go with Google's ecosystem or [Amazon's](https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-solarmovie-alternatives-watch-movies-online/), though, they're sure to be thrilled.
