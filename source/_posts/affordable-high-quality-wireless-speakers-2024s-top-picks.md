##  What to Look for in a Budget Bluetooth Speaker

 Just because you're looking for a budget Bluetooth speaker doesn't mean you need to compromise on most features. There are some things you'll want to keep in mind during your search!

 First, you'll want to check out the Bluetooth version. While Bluetooth 4.0 is all right, Bluetooth 5.0/5.3 is even better, providing faster pairing, stable connections, and wider coverage. Most budget Bluetooth speakers will have at least Bluetooth 5.0, and all the recommendations on our list do.

 You'll also want to consider whether you want a portable speaker. While all of the speakers on our list are portable, there are Bluetooth speakers that need a power source to work or may be too heavy to move around. In addition, if you want to take your speaker out into the wild, you'll want to look at its IP ratings and ensure it has proper [weather resistance](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 From there, other features, such as battery life, LED lighting, and range, will all vary based on what you want and how much you're willing to spend. Generally, more features mean more money, but if there's a feature you don't necessarily care about, you can save a bit and get a speaker that omits it.

 If you're always on the move and need a budget-friendly Bluetooth speaker for your car, the [Besign BK06 Car Bluetooth Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Speakerphone-Hands-Free-Streaming-Assistant/dp/B07KXRCCKY/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004648&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-budget-bluetooth-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a fantastic choice. It's designed specifically for car use, letting you enjoy your favorite audio and hands-free calling features.

 The Besign BK06 is super portable and has a visor clip, so you can easily switch it between cars. Just clip it to your sun visor, and you're good to go. It has dual 2-watt speakers, perfect for most cars, though it might struggle to be heard at high speeds with the windows down.

 One of the best features is its hands-free calling capability, which lets you pause your music when you take a call and resumes once the call ends. The motion auto-on feature is also great—it powers up and connects to your phone automatically when you open your car door.

 With Bluetooth 5.0, you get fast pairing, stable connections, and near-lossless audio. You can pair up to two devices simultaneously, and it even has an aux port to function as a Bluetooth adapter.

 The 1,000mAh battery lasts up to 20 hours on a single charge, so your entertainment won't stop on long journeys. Plus, it supports both Siri and Google Assistant for easy voice control.

### Can I bring a Bluetooth speaker onto a plane?

 You may bring a Bluetooth speaker on a plane provided it is in your carry-on luggage and not in your checked-in luggage. This is because they contain Lithium-ion batteries. You can go with a Bluetooth adapter instead, which allows you to stream in-flight entertainment to your wireless or wired headphones or headset.
