##  What to Look For in a Google Pixel 7 Pro Case

 When buying a case for your Pixel 7 Pro, the first thing to consider is how well it'll protect the device. Most protective cases are good enough to keep the glass back free from scratches, but you also have to worry about drops---you don't want to shatter your phone from an accidental fall.

 Rugged and folio cases offer the most protection, but they can be pretty bulky. If you prefer something more streamlined, look for covers with raised lips around your phone's screen and corners with air pockets.

 How much do you want to show off your new Pixel phone? You should consider a clear case if you're a big fan of the Pixel 7 Pro's metal visor-style camera bar. Otherwise, something more opaque is in order. There are also thin cases for those who want minimal bulk added to the device.

 Finally, the material a case is made of is a critical consideration. Most manufacturers opt for [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU) and silicone, which are cheap and flexible while feeling great in your hands. But if you want something more luxurious, leather is a great option. Meanwhile, the Pixel 7 Pro supports wireless charging, so look for compatible cases.

 Once you have your preferred features sorted, choosing a case from the hundreds of available options is still a chore. We've handpicked some of the best Google Pixel 7 Pro cases you can buy to ease your decision-making.

| Pros                        | Cons                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ✓ Stylish build             | ✗ No corner protection |
| ✓ Grippy design             |                        |
| ✓ Wireless charging support |                        |

 The [Caseology Parallax Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Z5V77FH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a well-balanced cover for the Pixel 7 Pro. Made with TPU, it features textured sides for enhanced grip and a 3D hexagon design on the back for an added touch of personality. Like the sides, the cool pattern also helps with grip.

 The case comes in several colors: [matte black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Z5V77FH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [sage green](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Z5SSZHN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [burgundy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Z5MV46G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [ash gray](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Z5WCDBR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's wireless charging compatible and can accommodate most screen protectors. The case has raised bezels around the screen (especially at the top and bottom) for added protection.

 However, it's not as robust as a rugged case would be, and there are no cushions for the corners. If you're prone to dropping your phone, you'll want something a bit more protective.

_ZZXX_

| Pros                                | Cons                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |

| ✓ Leather wallet case in fun colors |                            |
| ✓ Kickstand functionality           |                            |

 While few cases are in the realm of what most would consider expensive, the low price of the [ZZXX Leather Wallet Case](https://www.amazon.com/ZZXX-Google-Pro-Blocking-Kickstand/dp/B0B4RV76X1/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) makes this pick the most budget-friendly on our list.

 ZZXX doesn't skimp on features, either. The case's wallet can hold two cards and cash, and the soft PU leather build provides enough friction for a solid grip with RFID-blocking capabilities. It also comes with a TPU inner shell for added protection.

 Raised bezels protect the screen and camera from surface-level scratches, while precision cutouts guarantee easy access to ports and jacks. The buttons are also clicky. Best of all, it doesn't add much bulk and it's available in multiple colors.

| Pros                        | Cons                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✓ Multi-level protection    | ✗ Thicker than a regular case |
| ✓ Integrated kickstand      |                               |
| ✓ Wireless charging support |                               |
| ✓ MIL-STD rated             |                               |

 Spigen is a well-known brand in the smartphone protection world, so it's no surprise we have another pick from the manufacturer. Compared to similar protection-focused options with bulky builds, the [Tough Armor case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tough-Armor-Designed-Pixel/dp/B09YMTL3MM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) combines top-tier ruggedness with a design that's easy on the hand.

 Like the Slim Armor above, this case is made from [TPU](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) and polycarbonate for dual protection from drops and scratches. As with any rugged case, it features raised lips around the display.

 With air cushioning in the corners, this case does an excellent job of protecting your device against drops. It also boasts a military-grade rating ([MIL-STD](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/) 810G-516.6) for extra peace of mind. Plus, there's an integrated kickstand for comfortable media consumption.

 Interestingly, the case supports wireless charging and power-sharing, so you never have to take it off. While the Tough Armor is thicker than regular cases, it's still relatively compact compared to other rugged offerings.

| ✓ Wireless charging compatibility |                                         |

 One thing's for sure: the Pixel 7 Pro has a unique design. And a clear case like the [Ringke Fusion](https://www.amazon.com/Ringke-Anti-Fingerprint-Technology-Compatible-Translucent/dp/B0BFBPRPFY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the perfect way to protect your phone while showing off its style.

 The back of the case is made from matte-finished polycarbonate for fingerprint and smudge resistance, while the sides and corners are made from flexible TPU to cushion and absorb impact.

 It's also designed for maximum screen protector compatibility, so you can even use tempered glass that curves to the sides. However, this will reduce the lip height on either side.

 The Fusion case is pretty versatile too. It incorporates Ringke's Duo-QuikCatch holes for attaching accessories like straps, card holders, and more. It also supports wireless charging.

_CYRILL_

| Pros                   | Cons                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ✓ Thin design          | ✗ Won't do much for front impact |
| ✓ Matte finish         |                                  |
| ✓ Supports attachments |                                  |
| ✓ Cushioned edges      |                                  |

 It's true that slimmer phones are easier to transport and hold. Thin covers like the [CYRILL Stone case](https://www.amazon.com/CYRILL-Compatible-Flexible-Protective-Protection/dp/B0B1RZXVYY/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) allow you to protect your Pixel 7 Pro without adding too much bulk.

 Its one-body TPU build features a smooth matte finish to keep fingerprints and smudges at bay. Meanwhile, the sides have a glossy coating to increase grip.

 The CYRILL Stone case offers some drop protection thanks to a feature similar to Spigen's Air Cushion technology. And like the Fusion case, it allows you to attach straps and other accessories of your choice.

 It's important to note that you'll need to trade some protection for the slimmer profile of the CYRILL Stone. If you're looking for a rugged case, you may need to consider another option.

| ✓ Detachable folio design |                             |

 If you want a case that screams luxury without paying top dollar, the [DG.MING leather flip case](https://www.amazon.com/Protective-DG-MING-Cowhide-Magnetic-Detachable/dp/B0B84GBBQJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840548%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option. Made with genuine cowhide leather, it features a detachable folio design. The back of the inner bumper case is covered in leather, while the sides are made of plastic and TPU.

 The folio serves as a wallet for storing multiple credit cards and cash. It also doubles as a protective covering for your Pixel 7 Pro when not in use. The main downside of the leather case is that the folio design can be a bit cumbersome. But thankfully, it can be detached.
