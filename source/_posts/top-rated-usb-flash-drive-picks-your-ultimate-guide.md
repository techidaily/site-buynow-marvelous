##  What to Look for in a USB Flash Drive in 2023

 The primary factor you have to keep in mind when shopping for a flash drive (also known as a thumb drive) is how much storage you'll need. Flash drives can get pricey depending on the brand you buy and how powerful it is. Generally, it's better to go for a higher-capacity flash drive so that you don't fill it up and need a replacement quickly.

 Considering read and write speeds are also key to a good flash drive. If you handle large files regularly, you'll want to explore models with at least 100Mbps read speeds. Most flash drives today come with 150Mbps read speeds and write speeds that hover around 75-100Mbps, so this isn't too difficult of a requirement to hit. However, some of the cheaper flash drives on the market will have lower speeds, which will only cause you frustration in the long run, so be sure to double-check.

 Security is also an important factor, especially as flash drives are meant to be highly portable storage solutions, which means they can get lost or stolen more easily. You may want an extra layer of privacy if the files on the drive are particularly sensitive. Finding a flash drive with good encryption and smart features like a fingerprint reader is ideal for any security-centric buyer. If the files you're carrying around aren't sensitive, however, these security features aren't a much-have, though they're always nice bonuses.

 In our list, we've found the best options that strike an excellent balance between capacity, speed, and price and offer extra features like protecting your data from the elements and prying eyes.

##  Best Flash Drive Overall: [Samsung Fit Plus USB 3.1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7PDLXC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                     | Cons                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Compact design         | ✗ Not ideal for USB-C users                 |
| ✓ USB 3.1                | ✗ Top speeds require 128GB or 256GB storage |
| ✓ Water- and shock-proof |                                             |

 Our pick for the best flash drive for most people is [Samsung's Fit Plus](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7PDLXC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Featuring an incredibly compact design, this drive offers up to [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7Q41PM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) of storage and [USB 3.1](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-craft-powerful-tags-for-maximum-youtube-engagement/) speeds of 400Mbps. What's more, the drive is reasonably priced, with the [128GB model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7PDLXC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) costing just $23.

 The Fit Plus is [waterproof](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) for up to 72 hours in seawater, as well as shockproof at up to 1,500 gravitational acceleration. It's also magnet-proof and x-ray-proof.

 Oddly, Samsung only grants the larger-capacity [128GB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7PDLXC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7Q41PM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models faster storage, whereas smaller variants will be stuck with speeds that sit well below 400Mbps. In addition, this drive isn't ideal for those striving to switch all of their devices to USB-C since this drive sticks with a standard [USB-A port](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exploring-the-full-features-sony-fdr-x1000-model/).

 All in all, though, it's hard to find an alternative to the Fit Plus that's as well-rounded.

 For the money, you get a drive that offers a design instantly familiar to anyone.

Plus, it's backward compatible with [USB 2.0](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-methods-to-log-gaming-sessions/) ports.

 With no added external protection from water or shock, this flash drive won't be for those who may have gadget-centric accidents more often than not. And while read speeds remain a terrific 150Mbps, write speeds are an abysmal 4Mbps. If you're dealing with big files, you'll want to [up your budget a bit](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-uncover-the-past-your-complete-guide-to-digitizing-and-preserving-old-photographs/).

 If you can live with these caveats, the Ultra Flair offers a solid mix of smart features and simplicity that many will appreciate.

 If you need a flash drive that can manage a ton of data, you'll want to check out the [Kingston DataTraveler Max](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-1TB-USB-C-Performance/dp/B09DVQ32XQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

It's ideal for those who may have to regularly move big files like video projects around. It's also great if you'd rather have something compact like a flash drive over an [external solid-state drive](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-bring-your-clips-to-life-a-compreenased-way-to-post-on-youtube/).

 Without any water resistance or additional security features, the Kingston DataTraveler Max might not be for everyone. The storage also comes at a high price, costing quite a bit more than the other options on our list.

 But if what you're looking for is a flash drive with a lot of storage space that can make managing big files a breeze, it's certainly worth considering.

 If security is a priority for you, you'll want to check out [Lexar's JumpDrive Fingerprint F35](https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-LJDF35-128BNL-JumpDrive-Fingerprint-Silver/dp/B07GSMSL28?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206388&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F795657%2Fbest-usb-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The flash drive ships with an embedded fingerprint reader that, once set up, encrypts any data you have on it using 256-bit AES encryption. You can register up to 10 fingerprints, and unlocking your drive with your print takes less than one second.

 The JumpDrive uses USB 3.0 with up to 300Mbps read speeds, while write speeds are slower---though Lexar doesn't state what they are.

 Unfortunately, the software required to set up the fingerprint reader only works with Windows, so Mac and Linux users will only be able to use it as a standard flash drive. Lexar says it tests each drive for durability on its store page, but the company doesn't provide any further details.

 Still, if you're a Windows user who needs a secure flash drive that's secure and easy to use, the JumpDrive is an excellent choice.
