## Decoding Amazon Prime's Merit – Join Now
 Amazon Prime is an all-in-one subscription offering movie, TV, and music streaming, ebook reading, free shipping on Amazon orders, and more. We explored all of the membership benefits to help you decide if Amazon Prime is worth it or not based on your media consumption habits, household budget, and how much you shop on the Amazon website.

## What Is Amazon Prime?

 The Amazon Prime subscription service launched in 2005 and was primarily a paid membership that gave Amazon customers free two-day shipping. Since its launch, Amazon Prime’s list of benefits has significantly expanded to include access to other Amazon services such as[Prime Video](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363) , Prime Music,[Prime Gaming](https://www.lifewire.com/use-free-twitch-prime-subscription-4148447) , and[Prime Reading](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-reading-4160132) . The service is ever-evolving and frequently adjusts its features and various pricing plans to meet consumer and industry demands.

## Who Should Get Amazon Prime

 The Amazon Prime benefits are numerous, so one person’s reasons for subscribing could be completely different from someone else’s. You may want to subscribe to Amazon Prime if:

* You make regular Amazon purchases.
* You want to watch[Amazon Originals on Prime Video](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-free-streaming-for-prime-members-1847379) .
* You play a lot of PC games and like to subscribe to Twitch channels.
* You buy your groceries at Whole Foods Market.
* You regularly read ebooks and digital magazines.

* You don’t shop from Amazon.

* You use Spotify or Apple Music to listen to music.

## Why You Should Subscribe to Amazon Prime

 Amazon Prime has a lot of value, even if you use just a fraction of its features. Here are some of the biggest reasons you might want to try Amazon Prime.

### You Buy From Amazon on the Regular

 Depending on what you buy and where it’s shipping from, Amazon Prime’s free shipping for purchases from the Amazon website could completely cover the $14.99 Amazon Prime monthly fee if you make just one order per month. The Amazon Prime fee will definitely pay itself if you make at least two monthly orders. Amazon Prime is absolutely worth it if you buy products requiring international shipping.

 The Amazon Prime Annual fee is $139 per year. If you think you’d spend more than that on Amazon order shipping each year, Amazon Prime will pay for itself.

### You Order Most of Your Food From Amazon Outlets

 Amazon Prime members get same-day delivery, some delivery discounts, and free pickup at some locations with Amazon Fresh. Subscribers also receive[special discounts and delivery deals at Whole Foods Market](https://www.lifewire.com/use-amazon-prime-whole-foods-discount-4172132) locations. Amazon Prime could be an excellent value for the money, depending on how much grocery shopping you do via either.

### Amazon Originals Look Interesting to You

 Like most of its rivals, Prime Video, the streaming service included with Amazon Prime, also has several exclusive TV series and films that aren’t available anywhere else. While some are completely original productions like_Totally Killer_ , many are based on graphic novels and book series sold on Amazon and its Kindle e-readers, such as_The Boys_ ,_The Wheel of Time_ ,_Jack Ryan_ , and_The Terminal List_ . If you plan to watch these Amazon Originals or others, Amazon Prime will be worth it for you.

### You’re a Gamer Who Loves Watching Twitch

 Amazon Prime subscriptions include a service called Prime Gaming. Prime Gaming’s benefits include free PC video games every month and a free[Twitch subscription](https://www.lifewire.com/twitch-subscriptions-4147319) to any[Twitch channel](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-twitch-4143337) that you want. Prime Gaming occasionally has free content for mobile games such as Pokemon Go.

## When You Shouldn't Subscribe to Amazon Prime

 Many people love Amazon Prime, but it isn’t for everyone and may not be for you. Here are some reasons you may want to skip an Amazon Prime membership.

### You’re Not an Amazon or Whole Foods Shopper

 The Amazon and Whole Foods discounts and shipping deals are easily some of Amazon Prime’s more popular benefits amongst subscribers. However, if you don’t shop from either of these businesses or only do one shop at each a month, it’s unlikely that you’ll get your money’s worth.

### Netflix and Disney+ Have More Interesting Content

 One or two Amazon Originals may catch your eye, but once you’re done with those, you’ll likely find yourself switching back to rival services like Disney+ and[Netflix](https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831) . The rivals may technically have less overall content than Prime Video, but they might have more worth watching and talking about with friends and family.

### You Prefer Physical Books and Magazines

 If you’re not a fan of ebooks and digital magazines, the inclusion of Prime Reading, which gives you access to a few thousand ebooks and magazines, likely won’t appeal to you much. Even if you are a Kindle enthusiast, the Prime Reading library pales compared to the much larger one offered in the separate[Kindle Unlimited subscription service](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-kindle-unlimited-4178136) .

 An Amazon Prime account is required to access the Prime Video streaming service. Prime Video is one of the primary features of the Amazon Prime membership, alongside free shipping on Amazon orders and access to Amazon Music.

 Some movies and TV episodes can be purchased or rented from Prime Video without using an Amazon Prime membership. However, these titles are usually separate from the ones available to subscribers.

 Prime Student costs $7.49 per month instead of the usual $14.99 and features most of the same benefits as the regular Amazon Prime membership. Some exclusive extras include discounts on hotels and flights, three months of free Calm Premium membership, one month of Course Hero, and a $5 discount on the first Amazon Warehouse purchase. Discounts on textbooks and textbook renting are also included in Prime Student.
