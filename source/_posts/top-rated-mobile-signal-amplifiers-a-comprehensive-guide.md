## Comprehensive Guide: Finding Your Perfect Match

 Wrist rests are not one size fits all. A wrist rest that feels great to one user may not work for another. Maybe you prefer one made with supportive memory foam over a softer gel. Perhaps you feel better with a compact, low-profile design rather than a taller, cushier build.

 Here are our picks for the best keyboard wrist rests to suit various needs and preferences.

 Pros

* Soft, comfortable memory foam
* Non-skid base
* Comes with mouse wrist rest

 Cons

* Basic design

 Offering a solid combination of quality and value, it's not a big surprise that the ergonomic keyboard wrist rest from Gimars is a popular choice. It's long enough to pair nicely with any full-sized keyboard or laptop and tall enough to keep your hands at a natural, comfortable elevation level.

 The memory foam material provides plenty of cushion and support for your wrists, slowly bouncing back to its original shape when you lift your hands away. On the bottom, a textured anti-slip gel material keeps the wrist rest from sliding around on your desk, with small circular stickers included to help keep it even more secure.

 Adding to the product's value is the matching mouse wrist rest. Made of the same soft, breathable material, it's another valuable accessory for using a mouse with your computer.

 Pros

* Low price
* Mouse pad and mouse wrist rest included
* Comfortable memory foam material

 Cons

* Potential durability issues over time

 If you're looking to upgrade your home or office setup on a limited budget, the Yolanda wrist rest set gives you a lot of accessories for your money. In addition to the keyboard wrist rest, you get a smaller rest to use with your mouse and a mouse pad to protect your mouse and work surface.

 The keyboard wrist rest itself doesn't compromise much on quality, either. It's made of lightweight memory foam that feels soft on the wrists and helps them maintain proper positioning when you type. All three parts of the set lie flat without curling up, with non-slip rubber on the base to keep them from shifting around while you use them.

 While durability issues may be an issue after a certain amount of time, most people will get plenty of use for minimal cost.

**Material** : Memory foam |**No-Slip** : Yes |**Dimensions** : 17x3.3x1 inches

 Pros

* Bold two-color design
* Supportive gel pillows
* Built-in ventilation

 Cons

* Susceptible to damage

 Most keyboard wrist rests stick with simple, understated designs, but the Kensington Duo Gel Keyboard Wrist Rest quickly catches the eye. It's constructed with two sleekly curved sections—one black, the other in your choice of blue, red, or gray. The shine of the gel material on the inside helps it stand out even more.

 On the practical side, the split design creates a ventilation channel along the middle of the product, which helps to keep your hands dry and cool as you type away. Most importantly, for a wrist rest, the gel pillow material supports your wrists, holding its shape better than memory foam alternatives that may flatten over time. Thanks to a plastic surface, you can more readily wipe off than fabric coverings; it's also easier to clean.

 Pros

* Cleverly designed for laptop use
* Easy to reposition and travel with
* Usable with any keyboard or mouse

 Cons

* May not stay in place enough
* Pricey

 Just about any keyboard wrist rest can work with a laptop by positioning it in front of the machine. However, AQUUES Solutions specifically designed WavePads for notebooks. They consist of two squares of high-density memory foam on either side of the trackpad, providing support and comfort right where your wrists naturally fall when you type on your laptop keyboard.

 Non-stick surfaces on the base of the WavePads help keep them in place (though you might experience some slipping). These won't leave residue on your laptop without any adhesive materials.

 You can reposition them or even pick them up to take on the go, and you can use the provided elegant metal clip to carry them neatly while traveling. The portable, versatile nature of the WavePads also makes them great wrist rests for an external keyboard or mouse, not just laptops.

 Pros

* Supportive, ergonomic memory foam
* Compact and low-profile
* Ventilated surface

 Cons

* More flat and narrow than most options
* Simplistic design

 JEDIA's unassuming but adequate keyboard wrist rest is excellent for most workplaces. It's made of high-quality memory foam covered with smooth chinlon (a type of nylon) fabric. It provides support and comfort that leans on the firmer side.

 This wrist rest is also narrower and about half the height of the typical product on the market, making it ideal for smaller work areas where space is a premium.

 Other features include an anti-slip silicone base that minimizes sliding and rows of "massage holes" along the top. This feature improves ventilation by allowing air to flow underneath your wrists and hands.

 The JEDIA wrist rests come large for full-length keyboards. You can also get a shorter length that pairs well with units that don't include a dedicated number pad. Both versions come with a smaller wrist rest for use with a mouse.

**Material** : Memory foam |**No-Slip** : Yes |**Dimensions** : 17.24x2.68x0.59 inches

 Pros

* Combination of memory foam and cooling gel
* Durable anti-fray stitching
* Reasonably priced

 Cons

* Cloth covering can slip around

 PC gaming puts demands on users, and comfort and ergonomics while playing games on the keyboard can be just as crucial as when typing. The HyperX brand, known for its gaming accessories, offers a keyboard wrist rest built for gamers.

 Besides the soft memory foam cushioning, it also infuses in a cooling gel that helps keep your hands from getting too warm as you play. Fray-resistant stitching around the outside edges boosts its durability, while non-slip rubber on the bottom holds it on your desk.

 While gaming-specific gear often comes with flashy aesthetics and premium price tags, the HyperX wrist rest sports more of a minimalist design and a reasonable cost. These features combine to make it not just an exclusive gamer's product but a solid, all-purpose choice for office or general home use.

 Pros

* Soft yet supportive gel material
* Smooth, cleanable surface
* Long, slim profile

 Cons

* Elbow pressure can leave dents

 Wrist rests made with gel material tend to be softer and cooler than their memory foam counterparts, and this is the case with 3M's Gel Wrist Rest for Keyboards. Its gel feels somewhat firmer than other gel wrist rests, finding a happy medium between softness and support. It quickly bounces back into its original shape after you remove your hands, though it doesn't hold up well to direct pressure from your elbows.

 It also hits a nice balance with its cover material, which avoids the downsides of sticky plastic and absorbent fabric. The surface is smooth, satiny, and easy to wipe clean. Sizing is another aspect the 3M wrist rest gets right. Its 19-inch length works with just about any keyboard, while its narrow width and low profile make it easy to fit even in tight desk spaces.

**Material** : Gel |**No-Slip** : Yes |**Dimensions** : 19x1.9x0.60 inches

 Pros

* Comfortable and ergonomic
* Durable
* Unique, elegant style

 Cons

* Hard material not for everyone
* On the pricey side

 Those preferring to type with more responsive, "clicky" physical keys can opt for a[mechanical keyboard](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mechanical-keyboard-2640212) instead of a membrane keyboard that provides minimal tactile feedback. Mechanical keyboards call for a particular wrist rest to go with it, and that's where the wooden wrist rest from Glorious Gaming can shine.

 The white ash wood material isn't soft like foam or gel and won't suit everyone. However, it still provides the ergonomic positioning and comfort that wrist rests offer, especially for mechanical keyboards. A protective coating keeps the top surface smooth and sweat-resistant, and rubber pads underneath prevent slippage.

 The Glorious Gaming wooden rests come in various lengths, designed to fit full-size keyboards, smaller tenkeyless models (without a number pad), and even smaller compact sizes. There's even a size meant for use with a mouse.

**Material** : White Ash Hardwood |**No-Slip** : Yes |**Dimensions** : 17.5x4x0.75 inches

## What to Look for in a Keyboard Wrist Rest

### Material

 The material determines how comfortable a rest feels, how much support it provides, and how it positions your wrists—depending on your preferences. Many products use soft memory foam padding covered with fabric. Others use a cooler, squishier gel material within a smooth surface like plastic. More rarely, you may find wrist rests with leather surfaces or made of hardwood. It often comes down to trying out a product and seeing how it feels for you.

### Size and Shape

 Because a wrist rest should guide your body into a particular position, its size, and shape are essential on a functional level. A flatter wrist rest might put your hands at just the right height for your keyboard, or you may need a taller one to keep your wrists more elevated. If you use a compact keyboard or a tenkeyless (TKL) one that doesn't include a full number pad, you might want a shorter wrist rest that matches closer to that size. Most keyboard wrist rests also work for laptops.

### Durability

 It may be hard to gauge a wrist rest's durability or how long it will last you, but generally, you'll pay more for higher-quality construction and materials. Foam can flatten or deform, and gel pillows can be punctured. Some exterior surfaces are easier to clean and maintain than others, and some may have covers with reinforced stitching. Wooden wrist rests are as durable as they get, at the expense of softness.

 FAQ

* Is a keyboard wrist rest necessary?  
 While anyone can use a keyboard without one, wrist rests offer a lot of comfort and wellness benefits, especially for people who type or play computer games for long periods. Keeping your hands too high or too low, in addition to the repetitive motions, can lead to fatigue, wrist strain, and issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Wrist rests help support your wrists and keep them in a more natural position to avoid those concerns.
* How do I clean my keyboard wrist rest?  
 Wrist rests can gather dirt, oils, and other stains, but fortunately, most have easy-to-clean coverings or surfaces. Gel pads with plastic or similar smooth exteriors are the simplest to wipe off with a damp cloth or sponge. Foam wrist rests tend to use covers made from fabric, which may require some vacuuming or a bit of detergent, depending on the level of dirt or staining. Generally, you should avoid washing machines and dishwashers since they usually ruin the product.
* Should I choose a gel or foam keyboard wrist rest?  
 It's a matter of preference. Memory foam wrist rests are more common—they offer soft padding that contours somewhat to the shape of your wrist, but they may stay more flattened over time. Gel wrist rests are squishy, bounce back to shape quickly, and help keep your hands cool. Some users don't like the plastic surfaces they usually come with, though, and sharp objects may puncture and compromise the gel. If these common types don't work for you, alternative materials like leather and wood are also available.
