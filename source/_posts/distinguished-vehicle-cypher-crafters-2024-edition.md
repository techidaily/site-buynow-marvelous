 Pros

* Wireless and Ethernet
* Customizable scanning profiles
* Impressive touchscreen

 Cons

* Awkward setup process

 Fujitsu's ScanSnap iX1600 is everything you could hope for in a scanner. The all-in-one device offers several new and improved features, explaining why this is now Fujitsu's flagship scanner. Unlike its well-liked predecessor, the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500, the iX1600 includes a sizable 4.3-inch touchscreen display, faster scanning speeds, and improved software to accelerate your workflow.

 It's more than just speedy, too. The ScanSnap iX1600 offers up to 30 customizations and can connect from almost anywhere. That includes connecting wirelessly or wired, with a[USB Type-B connection](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-b-connector-2626033) , Wi-Fi ([2.4Ghz/5Ghz](https://www.lifewire.com/is-5-ghz-wifi-better-than-2-4-ghz-818293) ) capability, and Bluetooth connectivity. Thanks to so many connection options, creating individual users and separate profiles is possible depending on the scenario.

 However, while the functionality is impressive, the setup could be more comfortable on mobile devices. Our reviewer says, "The mobile apps could use some polish, but the computer app works great for setting up all your profiles." The iX1600 also scans a receipt destined for Dropbox, converts a document into an email, and transforms an array of physical documents into digital files with varying destinations.

 Pros

* Ability to scan large documents
* Easy to store
* Cloud storage support

 Cons

* Unable to scan film
* No auto document feeder

 If you need a scanner specifically for photos, the Epson Perfection V39 lives up to its name. The flatbed scanner is affordable and precise, producing digital documents with a 4,800[dpi](https://www.lifewire.com/dpi-in-graphics-1078848) optical resolution.

 Once you've scanned your document or photo, you can send it directly to an email address or cloud storage like Evernote or Google Drive. If you want to scan, save, and archive aging family photos or important documents without spending a fortune, the V39 is the ideal option. The scanner also has a removable lid to conveniently scan large and bulky items such as books, making it a portable photocopier ideal for students. It's storage-friendly, too, thanks to its well-designed build and an integrated kickstand that means you can store it vertically.

 The downside? There's no auto-document feeder, so scanning many documents can take a while. It's also unable to scan film and is not the fastest. Still, it's very convenient despite those flaws.

 Pros

* Individual scanning profiles
* Fast scanning speed
* 50-sheet automatic document feeder

 Cons

* No wireless connectivity
* No built-in touchscreen

 The Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1400 lacks the premium features of the iX1600, but it's still handy. While there's frustratingly no wireless connectivity or a built-in touchscreen, its scanning features are nearly indistinguishable from the pricier alternative.

 Whether you're scanning a business card, receipt, invoice, contract, or beloved photo, the iX1400 does so speedily. Our reviewer Gannon says he "didn't come across a single time when the scanner felt as though it was trying to play catch up with my computer—even when working with large, high-DPI scans of photographic prints."

 That's because the ScanSnap iX1400 scans at an impressive 40-page-per-minute (PPM) speed with a 50-sheet automatic document feeder, ensuring that batch scanning is effortless. The thoughtful design and excellent Fujitsu ScanSnap Home software make smooth scanning possible. The software makes it simple to create individual scanning profiles that you can toggle on as and when needed.

 A single button triggers scanning with customization, meaning you can guarantee your scanned document lands in the correct location.

 Pros

* Auto-scan mode
* Maximum DPI for clear scans
* Compact size

 Cons

* Setup process for Mac users is challenging

 The Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a highly affordable yet effective scanner. It offers an impressive set of features for the price, including the ability to scan directly to cloud storage.

 Wherever you plan to send your files, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400's auto-scan mode will detect the size of your documents and adjust accordingly, saving you some effort. It'll also scan to a maximum of 4800x4800 dpi, guaranteeing precise and accurate digital scans. Buttons on the front of the scanner make scanning even more manageable, with the scanner boasting 8-second speeds.

 Once scanned, it can create PDFs that can be saved directly to your computer's hard drive. It's all wonderfully straightforward and convenient, although there are some issues with its Mac setup process. Stick with it, though, and it pays off.

 Beyond the features and price tag, there's also the usual one-year warranty plus a year's worth of toll-free technical phone support, which you should not need. If you're looking for a scanner that gets the job done on a budget, the Canon CanoScan LiDE 400 Photo and Document Scanner is a great option.

 Pros

* Compact and portable design
* Great speed for single and double-sided documents
* Wi-Fi and USB connection options

 Cons

* No auto document feeder
* Can't easily process larger items

 Compact and ideal for any location, the Brother DSmobile DS-940DW is only about the size of a roll of plastic wrap to fit anywhere. It lacks an automatic document feeder because of this and any additional trays, which means it'll fit into a small home office setup.

 While the DSmobile DS-940DW isn't aimed at large projects, it still has impressive specifications. It can scan up to 16 pages per minute of single and double-sided documents or business cards without breaking a virtual sweat. Wi-Fi and USB are enabled, too, so it's easy to hook up to all your devices, whether a desktop, laptop, or mobile.

 Look for aging issues with scanning multiple documents into a single PDF, which should have been resolved with the latest software update.

 Pros

* Fast scan speed and accuracy
* 50-page automatic feeder
* Security features to protect scanned documents

 Cons

* Touchscreen is only 3 inches
* OCR isn't functional when scanning to mobile devices

 The convenience of the Brother ADS-2700W is obvious. With extensive wireless capabilities, staying untethered with this scanner is helpful, although it also has[Ethernet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ethernet-3426740) capability. Scanning is easy and efficient. Scanning to cloud storage, USB, email, a mobile device, and several other places is effortless.

 The scanner's image optimization features can automatically delete blank pages, enhance colors, and remove unnecessary backgrounds. It'll scan with the assistance of a 50-page auto feeder. Security features include[SSL and TLS](https://www.lifewire.com/tls-vs-ssl-4156306) , a secure file transfer protocol, and a settings lock for those worried about scanning confidential documents.

 The only real downside here is the touchscreen is pretty tiny, at just under 3 inches. That makes navigating difficult for some people, plus OCR isn't functional when scanning to a mobile device. Despite that, the ADS-2700W is very practical and worth checking out.

 Pros

* Lightweight and portable
* Designed to quickly scan cards and small documents
* Can convert into PDF file

 Cons

* Can only scan small items
* Not the fastest at scanning

 If you need a scanner for small documents like business cards or pictures, the Ambir DP667 Card Scanner is perfect. It's USB-powered and easy to use from pretty much anywhere.

 It can scan business cards or documents measuring up to 4x10 inches, maintaining an impressive 600 dpi resolution. Once scanned, you can easily convert the results into[PDF](https://www.lifewire.com/pdf-file-2622916) documents. The downside here is the DP667 Card Scanner isn't the fastest scanner on the market. You'll need patience when scanning business cards, licenses, or receipts, but it's easy to use.

 Whether you're keeping up with your networking at a conference or processing ID cards at a hotel desk, the DP667 Card Scanner has you covered. It's as simple as it is effective.

### Media Type

 How are you planning to use it? A portable scanner might be your best option if you only scan business cards. Alternatively, if you're looking to scan family heirlooms, you want a model that captures high-quality photos rather than focuses on OCR conversion. For an office environment, being able to scan text well is critical. Depending on your budget, higher-end units are great at everything you throw at them. They can include adjustable sliders, separate bays, and features that simplify the results.

### Scan Speed

 If you're often short on time, impatient, or have many items to scan, you want a scanner that can keep up with you. Look at how many pages a scanner can handle per minute. Also, consider scanners with automatic document feeders if you scan many documents simultaneously. It'll save you time and effort. However, if you only do it occasionally, you may be better off spending less or focusing on something with more features.

### Cloud Support

 Do you want to be able to access your scanned documents from anywhere? That's an option if you pick a scanner with cloud support. Many document and photo scanners offer such functionality to scan and upload files directly to the cloud. Look for one that supports Google Drive, Dropbox, or your preferred cloud service for maximum efficiency.

### Portability

 You won't have to worry about storage if you have a large home office or small business setup. However, if you're tight on space or want to take a document scanner with you wherever you go, look for one that's small and lightweight. A bulky solution will only slow you down and is best suited for a permanent home in your office.  

 FAQ

* What should you prioritize when buying a document scanner?  
 Every scanner is flawed, so weighing what you need most is crucial. If you need to scan documents occasionally rather than daily, the scanning speed may be less critical. In all cases, though, it's good to look for an accurate scanner so that the results look perfect every time. An automatic document feeder is often helpful, but it's optional if you need to scan only a few documents at a time. A better option would be to pick a scanner with suitable software to help you out.
* Are different connectivity types essential?  
 Depending on how you plan to use your document scanner, having different connectivity options at your disposal can be helpful. Many scanners offer Wi-Fi support, which is useful if you plan on scanning to a mobile device or don't want to be tied down by cables. However, Wi-Fi support is optional if you have a correctly wired home office setup.
* Which is the most common type of scanner?  
 A flatbed scanner is the most common type; inserting documents is generally much more accessible. Some require you to feed the paper manually, making it tricky to do so without damaging the physical item. Look for the most convenient method for your plans. A removable lid can be helpful if you plan on scanning large documents such as books.
