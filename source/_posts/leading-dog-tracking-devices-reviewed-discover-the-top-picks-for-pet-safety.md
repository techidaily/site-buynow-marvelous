##  What to Look for in a GPS Dog Tracker in 2024

 Many products on the market promise to track your pets if they go missing. Some are designed specifically for pet tracking, and others are general tracking devices. The right type of tracker depends on your use case, but we've only included trackers that use GPS technology for tracking your dog.

 Devices such as Apple's [AirTags](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0933BVK6T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) aren't included here because they don't use GPS technology for positioning. GPS trackers are more expensive and have a much shorter battery life than [Bluetooth trackers](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fixing-microsoft-edge-crashes-in-windows-11-effective-solutions-discovered/), but you get instant and precise location data for your pet.

 Speaking of battery life, GPS trackers can vary considerably from device to device. Some of this depends on the size of the tracker, which influences the size of the battery. But additional features such as Bluetooth or WiFi connectivity usually mean the device is more power-hungry. Some trackers, such as those used with hunting dogs, only offer half a day's battery life. General-purpose GPS trackers may need a recharge every few days.

 Then there are the two general types of GPS trackers. The first contains a cellular modem and a SIM card. GPS is a one-way network, so you need some way to send those coordinates back to the dog's owner. Using cellular data is generally the best way since cellular coverage is generally immense. However, these services almost always have a subscription fee, usually one that quickly dwarfs how much you spend on the tracker itself.

 The second type of tracker doesn't have a cellular modem and doesn't require a subscription in most cases. Instead, the tracker uses radio to communicate with a unit you keep. However, the downside to these radio trackers is that you're typically limited to only a few miles of coverage.

 Radio trackers are used with working dogs for hunting, search and rescue, or any situation where you're close to the dogs but can't always keep your eyes on them. The tracker or tracking collar only represents half the cost since you also need to purchase a receiver. However, receivers can usually track multiple dogs, so you don't need to buy multiple.

 Apart from basic tracking, many dog trackers, regardless of type, have extra features. [Geofencing](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-icloud-lock-on-your-apple-iphone-12-pro-and-ipad-by-drfone-ios/), for example, is a common additional feature on these trackers and can alert you when the animal leaves a certain area. Some apps can track your dog's behavior and fitness activities.

 The tracker may also have other technologies besides GPS to enhance its accuracy so that you can determine the precise direction of the animal when you're getting close to the GPS coordinates. Whether these extra features are worth paying for depends on why you want a tracker in the first place.

 Now that you've figured out what you're looking for in a GPS dog tracker, here are the best available today.

Tractive

| Pros                                               | Cons                  |

| Good price                                         | Requires subscription |
| Works with AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Viaero USA |                       |
| Fits any collar                                    |                       |
| Works worldwide                                    |                       |
| Waterproof                                         |                       |

 The [Tractive LTE GPS Dog Tracker](https://www.amazon.com/Tractive-LTE-GPS-Dog-Tracker/dp/B08M6H284G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is probably the most full-featured tracker you can buy. It offers live tracking as long as the dog is within cellular coverage, location history, and virtual fencing, so you'll be alerted if your pet escapes or is stolen.

 One highly impressive feature is compatibility with almost all carriers in the US and carriers in over 150 countries worldwide. So if you're going overseas, you just pick up a compatible SIM card at your destination and never worry about losing your pet in a foreign country.

 Apart from having almost all the features anyone would need, the Tractive is [waterproof and rugged](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), so there won't be any problems with your dog running through a river or rolling in the mud and shorting out their collar.

 Battery life is also great, lasting up to 6 days, [according to users](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L1SDK7LV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The required subscription starts at $5 a month, which isn't the highest we've seen. As long as you don't mind paying a subscription, this is a fantastic tracker for your dog.

 The [Jiobit tracker](https://www.jiobit.com/pets) has a few things that make it stand out from the pack. It's significantly smaller than much of the competition, so if you have a small dog or a cat, this is a light and comfortable option for them.

 Despite being so small, it has a much better battery life than other larger trackers. Jiobit rates the battery endurance at up to two weeks, which is at least twice as much as other GPS trackers we've seen. Jiobit also has plenty of smart functionality in the [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU205410/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jiobit.app&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jiobit-for-families/id1221059964) app, including geofencing, movement history, and more.

 The Jiobit makes great use of [Bluetooth](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insta-to-tik-integration-masterclass/) technology. If your pet is close enough to a registered carer, you can track them via Bluetooth instead of GPS. If your pet does get lost, it can also use Bluetooth signal strength as a more precise indication of the dog's distance from you.

 Jiobit's tracker is water-resistant (not waterproof) and will work with virtually any collar, although you may have to buy [additional attachment accessories](https://www.jiobit.com/shop/all#attachment-methods) depending on what you want to clip it on. The device does require a subscription but at least it doesn't need a [SIM card](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-superior-video-editing-software-for-online-sessions/) for cellular service.

 The data plan includes international data, so you can take your dog overseas to a supported country and won't have to do anything special to keep tracking them. Subscriptions start at $15 for a month-to-month plan but work out progressively cheaper if you take a longer contract. The six-month contract comes to $13 per month, and the 2-year contract will cost you $9 per month.

If you want a dog tracker that doesn’t require a monthly or annual subscription and are willing to spend some more money upfront, then we recommend the [Garmin TT15X GPS Dog Tracker and Trainer](https://www.amazon.com/Tracking-Training-Stimulation-Water-Resistant-High-Sensitivity/dp/B09RD85CMR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 Garmin makes excellent trackers and smart devices for pets and humans, and the TT15X is no exception. This feature-packed dog tracker also doubles as a trainer, meaning you can both monitor their whereabouts and help them outgrow bad habits and cultivate new ones. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life, allowing you to observe and keep track of your dog for long periods.

 When paired with a compatible Garmin handheld (sold separately), you can easily track your doggo for up to nine miles. The handheld also allows you to extend battery life by remotely putting the tracker-trainer in sleep mode. Once the tracker is active again, the handheld allows you to activate LED beacon lights, so you can track your dog’s movements even in the dark. 

 And if your dog wades into the water while away, the Garmin TT15X is waterproof down to 10 meters and rugged enough to handle all that and more. If your hunting dog gets stuck in the swamp and is unable to move, the Garmin TT15X will let you know, so you can rush to their rescue. With the handheld, you can track and train up to three different dogs.

 The Garmin TT15X supports dog training with 18 levels of continuous and momentary stimulation to help get your dog’s attention and make them comply with instructions. When paired with the handheld, it offers audible tone and vibration for even better results.

 The Garmin TT15X is compatible with all existing Garmin Alpha, Garmin PRO 550 Plus, and Garmin Astro 430 devices, which can be costly. However, if you need multi-dog tracking in rough conditions, investing in Garmin's system is well worth it.

| Pros                                   | Cons                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Very inexpensive by itself             | Collar clips are an extra purchase |

 The [Cube Real-Time Tracker](https://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-Worldwide-Coverage-Real-Time-Subscription/dp/B08H5S9QZ5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a compact unit with a SIM card and a subscription ranging from $17 to $20, depending on your commitment. This general tracker is not specifically designed for pets, but it's part of the use cases Cube had in mind.

 This is one of the best alternatives to long-term tracking devices that don't use GPS, like [Tile](https://www.amazon.com/Tile-Bluetooth-Battery-Water-Resistant-Compatible/dp/B09998MBFM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or [Apple AirTags](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0933BVK6T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The battery on the Cube can last anywhere from 10 to 60 days, depending on which features you activate.

 The tracker is packed with GPS, cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It can use all four to pinpoint position, but that will give you the lowest battery life. Depending on your needs, you can keep some on and others off to extend the battery life.

 The Cube is inexpensive, but you'll have to buy a third-party collar mounting solution or the [OEM clips from Cube](https://www.amazon.com/Strap-Attachment-Clips-Cube-Tracker/dp/B08S48DX7K?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205410&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F815006%2Fbest-gps-dog-tracker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), which cost $25\. If you're mainly concerned about your pet being stolen or escaping, rather than real-time tracking during activities or walks, Cube is a great choice.
