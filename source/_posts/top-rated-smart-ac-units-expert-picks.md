##  What to Look for in a Smart Air Conditioner in 2024

 Smart air conditioners aren't as glamorous as [smart thermostats](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/top-four-social-networking-sites-facebook-twitter-instagram-and-youtube/), but if you're living in a building without central A/C, they can radically improve your living situation. These come in two different formats, and beyond figuring out which format is best for your home, there are a few other things to consider.

 Window-mounted and portable are the two most common designs for smart air conditioners. As you'd expect, window-mounted units are the ones that sit on the frame of your window and are visible from both inside and outside your home. These are great if you don't want to take up precious floor space.

 Portable designs are the other format for smart air conditioners. These are typically larger than window-mounted units and sit on your floor with a vent running to your window. They're not portable enough to make you want to frequently move them from room to room---but you can easily wheel them a few feet or change their direction to better cool your home.

 Technically, p[ortable air conditioners](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-top-10-lost-and-found-techniques-for-iphone-x/) are easier to move around your home than window-mounted units, but you'll still need to go through a fairly lengthy process to swap them from one location to the next. However, if you plan to move your air conditioner, you'll want to look at portable models.

 Once you've decided which format fits your needs, you'll want to consider the space you're trying to cool. Smart air conditioners are rated for different spaces, so you'll want to find a size rating that will work best with the room you'll looking to cool. Portable units work best for larger spaces, but you can find decent options for most room sizes in both categories.

 Those are the two biggest factors to consider when hunting down a smart air conditioner, but there are plenty of secondary factors. This includes whether your prospective unit supports Alexa or Google Assistant, if it comes with a companion app, how loud it is while operating, and the overall look of the air conditioner (because, let's face it, some air conditioners are an absolute eyesore).

 Thankfully, it's easy to find a smart air conditioner that checks all the right boxes. If you need help getting your search off the ground, here are the five best smart air conditioners, which cover various budgets, room sizes, and design options.

| ✓ Cools up to 550 sq. ft.                      | ✗ Expensive |
| ✓ Helps save on electricity                    |             |
| ✓ Works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa |             |

 If you want to cool your home fast, you can't beat the [Midea Duo Smart Inverter Portable Air Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/MAP14HS1TBL-Inverter-Portable-Conditioner-Dehumidifier/dp/B091CKVY9F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The big selling point of this air conditioning unit is its duo hose design---which allows it to both intake and exhaust air outdoors for an experience that's more sophisticated than most other products on the market.

 Beyond impressive cooling, the Midea Duo Smart Inverter is built to use 40% less energy compared to US Federal standards, operates at a quiet 42dB, and supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. There's also a robust [smartphone app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU202017/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.midea.aircondition.obm&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) so you can control your A/C after leaving the home---which is great if you forgot to change the settings before heading to work in the morning.

 There's a lot to love about Midea's premium smart air conditioner, but it comes at a price. Specifically, that price is $700\. Still, if you need a well-rounded way to keep your home cool that doesn't cut any corners, you won't find anything better.

| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| ✓ Simple install process             | ✗ Only rated to cool 350 sq. ft. |
| ✓ Great price                        |                                  |
| ✓ Google Assistant and Alexa support |                                  |

 Clocking in at around $400, the [Windmill Air Conditioner Smart Home AC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XN36B1B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) needs to be on the list of every frugal shopper. Not only is it affordable, but the installation process is remarkably simple, thanks to a window A/C unit that's largely preassembled out of the box.

 The biggest tradeoff you'll make when opting for the Windmill Air Conditioner is that it's only rated to handle rooms up to 350 square feet. This might not cut it if you have a big open studio to cool. But if you want to cool a room and make it be more comfortable, there's no reason to dismiss this lower-priced option.

 With an accompanying [smartphone app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU202017/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.windmillair&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US), support for Alexa and Google Assistant, and a reliable company reputation, few smart air conditioners under $500 can do what this unit can. Other notable features include a fairly modern design, an auto-dimming LED display, and a quiet operating noise that's just 50 dB at the lowest setting.

Best Budget Smart Air Conditioner

#####  Windmill Air Conditioner Smart Home AC

With tons of smart home features, a powerful smartphone app, and easy assembly, there's a lot to love about the ultra-affordable Windmill Air Conditioner Smart Home AC.

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XN36B1B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                                           | Cons                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Unique and highly functional U-shaped design | ✗ Unsuitable for side-to-side sliding windows |
| ✓ Low noise operation with high energy savings |                                               |
| ✓ Wide coverage up to 350 sq. ft               |                                               |

 If you’re looking for a robust smart AC unit specifically designed for window use, then look no further than the [Midea U-Shaped Smart Inverter Window Air Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Midea-Inverter-Conditioner-Flexibility-Installation/dp/B08677DCKN/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Its unique U-shape lets you easily open and shut your window, which is something a lot of ACs don't allow regardless of its smart functionality. This design uses your window to block external noise, allowing the AC to operate at an ultra-quiet 32-42 dBA.

 The disadvantage of such a unique design, however, is installing it, which will take more steps than it would a typical window AC unit. You may also be worried about security with how the design works, but don't be—Midea also incorporated an anti-theft locking mechanism.

 The 8,000 BTU Smart Inverter AC provides cooling for up to 20 feet, enough to cover 350 sq. ft of space. It's also incredibly energy efficient, as the DC inverter helps conserve energy along with helping to make the smart AC quieter.

 Wi-Fi enabled, you can easily control the Midea U-Shaped Smart AC from the MSmartHome app on your [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smarthome-formerly-msmarthome/id1254346490) or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU202017/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.midea.ai.overseas&hl=en&gl=US) device, or using the remote control. It also supports voice commands and comes with installation kits. It is equally available in [12,000 BTU with Matter support](https://www.amazon.com/Midea-Inverter-Conditioner-Flexibility-Installation/dp/B0CGNBS85W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| Pros                                        | Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Highly portable with rollers for mobility | ✗ Noisy for some people                       |
| ✓ High capacity air conditioner             | ✗ Unclear installation/operation instructions |
| ✓ Up to 450 sq. ft of coverage              |                                               |

 If you want a smart AC that is about as powerful as the Midea U-Shaped Smart AC but not a window unit, then we recommend the [TOSOT Portable Smart Air Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/TOSOT-Portable-Conditioner-Dehumidifier-Installation/dp/B0BPLQFLRJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This smart AC is easy to move from room to room, and it can also function as a fan or dehumidifier.

 Measuring 13.5 x 13.5 x 27.2 inches and weighing 66.9 lbs, this TOSOT AC features a simple portable design and rollers that allow you to easily move it around until you find the perfect spot. However, some parts of the installation and other features [aren't always clear to the user](https://www.amazon.com/TOSOT-Portable-Conditioner-Dehumidifier-Installation/dp/B0BPLQFLRJ/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but once you get the hang of it, moving the air conditioner around will be a cinch.

 The 12,000BTU TOSOT Portable Smart Air Conditioner packs enough power to cool up to 400 sq. ft of space with a noise level of about 56 dBA. This noise may be noticeable for some, but if you're not too bothered by white noise in the background, this won't be a deal-breaker for you.

 In sleep mode, its temperature is automatically regulated, so you don’t get too cold or hot while you sleep. In cool mode, the unit switches on/off when it reaches a preset temperature, saving energy. However, note that there may be a 3-minute lag in between. What’s more, it is Wi-Fi enabled and can be controlled by voice via the Gree+ app on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gree/id1167857672) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU202017/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gree.greeplus&hl=en&gl=US).

| Pros                                         | Cons                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ✓ 3-in-1 functionality with three fan speeds | ✗ No smart home features |
| ✓ Customizable operating schedule            | ✗ Old-school design      |
| ✓ Sleep Mode saves energy                    |                          |

 Smart air conditioners are cool, no doubt, but every situation requires one. Sometimes, a traditional “dumb” AC is what you need. For such situations, we recommend the [Frigidaire FFRE153WAE Window-Mounted Air Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/FRIGIDAIRE-Window-Mounted-Mini-Compact-Conditioner-Mechanical/dp/B07RFNGZVY/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 This 15,100 BTU air conditioner features the traditional window unit AC design and is capable of cooling 850 sq. ft of space at a noise level of 52 dBA, which is quieter than the [TOSOT Smart Portable AC](https://www.amazon.com/TOSOT-Portable-Conditioner-Dehumidifier-Installation/dp/B0BPLQFLRJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202017&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F887215%2Fbest-smart-air-conditioners%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) above. This is impressive for a window unit of this capacity, as usually, the more powerful an AC is, the louder it gets.

 The Frigidaire FFRE153WAE also works as a fan and a dehumidifier, regulating the temperature and humidity around your space. It's even Energy Star certified, thanks to its helpful energy-saving features such as 24-hour programmable modes and a Sleep Mode.

 Although the Frigidaire FFRE153WAE doesn’t support Wi-Fi or voice control, it does come with a remote with which you can remotely manage its many functions. If you decide you need smart functionality later on, you can even make [this dumb AC smart](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-filmmakers-companion-for-advanced-lut-expertise/) later on.

### Can I use a smart plug with an air conditioner?

 Yes, you can technically use a smart plug with an air conditioner. However, it’s worth noting that a smart plug will only turn your A/C unit on or off and has no way to directly control other features on your unit.

### Are smart air conditioners worth it?

 If you want the convenience that comes with controlling your air conditioner with a smartphone or other smart platform, then yes, smart air conditioners are worth it. But if you’ve never experienced issues with your standard air conditioner, you might not need to make an upgrade.

### How do I clean an air conditioner?

 Steps for cleaning an air conditioner vary by product. Most involve some combination of washing a filter, removing built-up dust, and brushing out any gunk collecting around its edges. However, make sure to read the owner's manual to ensure you don't accidentally damage your unit while cleaning.

### How do I install a smart air conditioner?

 This varies widely by product, and you will need to consult your owner's manual for proper installation. Some must be carefully mounted onto your window, while others sit on your floor and simply need an exhaust vent that runs outside your home.
