##  What to Look For in a Gaming Projector in 2023

 A projector is a great way to get a truly immersive gaming experience. But before you go shopping, here are a few things to remember.

 If there is one feature you want in a gaming projector, it’s low input lag. The input lag is basically the time between you pressing a button on your keyboard, mouse, or controller and its result showing up on the display. It can be the difference between winning or losing a game, particularly when quick reactions are needed. Input lag of less than 30ms is typically decent, but anything below 20ms is considered excellent. You would also want high [refresh rate](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-build-stellar-youtube-beginnings-on-a-shoestring-budget/) support as it makes gameplay smoother and more responsive.

 The resolution is another feature to consider. High-resolution projectors deliver a crystal clear picture with crisp detail, and it’s best to go with a [4K resolution](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/). Otherwise, you will notice the apparent lack of detail in a lower-resolution picture. 4K projectors can be expensive, though, and 1080p projectors are also pretty good, and you won’t see much difference if you sit at a reasonable distance.

 Moreover, consider portability, space constraints, brightness, and sound system, depending on your requirements.

##  Best Gaming Projector Overall: [BenQ X3000i](https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Projector-Cinematic-Experience-X3000i/dp/B09DTQJJZX/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gaming-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![benq-x3000i](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/benq-x3000i.jpg) 

BenQ

| Pros                                          | Cons                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 4K resolution                                 | Black levels could be better            |
| Low input lag                                 | No Ethernet connectivity for Android TV |
| Special presets for RPGs, SPGs, and FPS games |                                         |
| Included Android TV dongle                    |                                         |

 Part of BenQ’s Immersive Gaming series, the [X3000i](https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Projector-Cinematic-Experience-X3000i/dp/B09DTQJJZX/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gaming-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has much to offer. It’s a 4K DLP projector that’s rated for 3,000 ANSI lumens brightness and can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color space. As a result, you get a bright and vibrant picture whether you are gaming or watching movies or TV shows.

 Being a gaming-focused projector, it has an impressively low input lag. You can expect under 20ms for 4K or 1080p 60Hz input, under 10ms for 1080p 120Hz input, and under 5ms for 1080p 240Hz input. BenQ has also included three gaming presets for RPG, FPS, and SPGs, and these are designed to tweak the video and audio settings to offer an enhanced experience, depending on the game.

 Other highlights include Android TV support via a dongle that goes inside the projector to enjoy media streaming apps and more. It also enables Chromecast support.

 The installation is relatively painless, and in terms of the port selection, you get two HDMI 2.0 ports, one USB-A port, and a VGA port. There is also HDR10 support and twin 5W speakers for audio. The built-in speakers are decent for casual use. But if you want great sound, you can attach your own sound system via 3.5mm, S/PDIF audio-out, [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/), or Bluetooth.

 Although there is a [ton to like about the X3100i](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/process-of-screen-sharing-nokia-c22-to-pc-detailed-steps-drfone-by-drfone-android/), its black levels aren’t the best, and you only get Wi-Fi for network connectivity while using Android TV. The latter isn’t a deal-breaker, but having an [Ethernet](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-extract-and-save-fb-videos-the-cutting-edge-of-top-5/) port would have been excellent.

Best Gaming Projector Overall

#####  BenQ X3000i

With 4K resolution, 100% DCI-P3 color gamut, and low input lag, the BenQ X3000i delivers stunning visuals and an impressive gaming experience.

[$1300 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Projector-Cinematic-Experience-X3000i/dp/B09DTQJJZX/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gaming-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) [See at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbenq-x3000i-true-4k-hdr-4led-smart-gaming-projector-with-preset-game-modes-white%2F6502604.p) [See at B&H Photo Video](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1686756-REG/benq%5Fx3000i%5F3000%5Flumen%5F4k%5Fuhd.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU2000924) 

##  Best Budget Gaming Projector: [Optoma HD28HDR](https://www.amazon.com/Optoma-Projector-Compatible-Enhanced-High-Bright/dp/B084TSNVRJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gaming-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![optoma-28hdhdr](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/optoma-28hdhdr.jpg) 

Optoma

| Pros                                         | Cons                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| HDR support and 3,600 ANCI lumens brightness | No smart operating system     |
| Affordable                                   | Internal speaker is not great |
| Can accept 4K signals                        | HDR performance is middling   |

 You don’t necessarily need to spend the big bucks to get a solid gaming experience on a projector, and the [HD28HDR from Optoma](https://www.amazon.com/Optoma-Projector-Compatible-Enhanced-High-Bright/dp/B084TSNVRJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gaming-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) can help you with that. It’s a 1080p, HDR-capable projector that provides a fantastically low input lag for responsive gaming and supports a 120Hz refresh rate. You also get a 50,000:1 contrast ratio and a claimed brightness of 3,600 ANCI lumens brightness. While the projector doesn’t reach those brightness levels in real-life usage, it still gets plenty bright.

 Moreover, while it displays full-HD resolution, it can accept 4K signals, which is helpful when the source is only adding HDR to 4K, like in the case of some streaming services. [HDR10 and HLG](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) support is also available to enjoy high dynamic range content. But you won’t get an impressive HDR experience.

 Among other highlights, there are two HDMI ports: one, HDMI 1.4, which is helpful for HD and full HD sources, and the other, HDMI 2.0, is perfect for 4K inputs. You also get a USB Type-A port and a 3.5mm audio jack.

 Unfortunately, there is no built-in smart OS. So you’ll have to rely on streaming devices to get your fix of Netflix, Disney+, or other services. The internal 5W speaker is also not very helpful, except in a small room. So you’ll be better served by an external sound system.

 All in all, while it lacks some of the features present in more expensive models, it offers a good balance of price and features.

XGIMI

| Pros                                               | Cons                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Excellent picture quality and Dolby Vision support | Limited to 60Hz refresh rate                  |
| Low input lag                                      | Lacks a built-in kickstand or adjustable legs |
| Built-in speakers are powerful                     |                                               |

 While our best overall recommendation—the BenQ X3000i—is a fantastic 4K gaming projector, you can also consider the [XGIMI Horizon Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-HORIZON-Ultra-Projector-Bluetooth/dp/B0CB36K662/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gaming-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It’s an equally excellent 4K gaming projector with 3,000 ANSI lumens brightness and low input lag. Gaming feels responsive, and the picture quality is great. But you are limited to a 60Hz refresh rate.

 The [Horizon Ultra](https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unveiling-tiktoks-hidden-secrets-top-7-emoji-exploration-guide/) also shines in terms of audio quality. Its twin 12W Harmon Kardon speakers get pretty loud and will work just fine in most use cases. But you can connect an external speaker using eARC, the 3.5mm audio jack, and the optical port.

 In other highlights, XGIMI has included HDR10 and [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) support. So you can enjoy HDR content and games from various sources.

 Besides its solid feature set, the Horizon Ultra is a looker. It uses PU leather and fabric finishes for an elegant design. Plus, like most other projectors, it includes an Android TV dongle for enjoying streaming content. Unfortunately, installing Netflix isn’t as simple as going to the Google Play Store and hitting install on the Netflix listing. That said, the company does give instructions on how you can install Netflix.

 Another pain point with the Horizon Ultra is the lack of a built-in kickstand or adjustable legs, so it’s a bit tricky to get the right angle. Moreover, it relies on a single tripod screw for the ceiling mount, not a proper mounting system.

XGIMI

| Pros                                            | Cons                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Good picture quality with reasonable brightness | No handle for easy portability |
| Decent input lag for casual gaming              | No zoom or lens shift support  |

 Besides its impressive Horizon Ultra 4K projector, XGIMI offers the [Halo+](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fxgimi-halo-fhd-smartportableprojector-with-harman-kardon-speaker-and-android-tv-silver%2F6518392.p), a solid choice for anyone wanting a portable gaming projector. It’s a 1080p projector but can negotiate a 4K HDR signal, which it down-converts to full-HD for excellent picture quality.

 The [Halo+](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/master-the-nft-market-leading-generators-for-digital-masters-for-2024/) is also rated for 875 ANSI lumens brightness, but the actual brightness is noticeably lower, particularly when you are using battery power. But this is typical for battery-powered projectors. In terms of battery backup, the company promises 2.5 hours on a single charge, enough for a decent gaming session.

 Input lag isn’t very low at 26.5ms with the projector’s Game Mode Boost. But this is decent for casual gaming. Also, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better input lag in battery-powered portable projectors.

 The audio is powered by two 5W Harman Kardon speakers, which are decent. But there is support for external sound systems via eARC, a 3.5mm audio jack, and Bluetooth, like most of our other recommendations.

 Other features include a built-in Android TV platform with Chromecast support and a single HDMI port for connecting gaming consoles, PCs, or streaming devices. There is one USB Type-A port as well to connect external drives.

 Unfortunately, like most projectors in this category, you don’t get zoom or lens shift support. Plus, even though it’s a portable projector, it lacks a handle for carrying it around easily.

| Pros                                    | Cons                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Designed for Xbox-certified             | Not so great input lag while gaming in 4K |
| Low input lag in 1440p and 1080p gaming | Lacks ARC or eARC support                 |

 Looking for a short-throw gaming projector? It’s hard to go wrong with the [X2-4K from ViewSonic](https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-X2-4K-Projector-Cinematic-Adjustment/dp/B0BTLTDCPY/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-gaming-projectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This Designed for Xbox-certified 4K projector is all about gaming. It’s rated for 2,000 ANSI lumens brightness and can cover 125% of the Rec.709 color gamut. This results in a crisp, bright picture that looks fantastic.

 As you can expect, being a gaming projector, it has an incredibly low input lag of 8.4ms for 1080p 120Hz gaming and 4.2ms for 1080p 240Hz gaming. However, the input lag rises to 33.4ms for 4K 60Hz gaming. While it’s not the best in the business, it’s still decent.

 Another highlight of the ViewSonic offering is its ability to play Xbox titles in 1440p 120Hz, something you can’t do with many other projectors. The input lag in 1440p 120Hz is also pretty good at 16.8ms.

 Dual 6W Harman Kardon speakers have good sound quality with a wide sound stage, but they don’t get very loud, which isn’t surprising. So, if you need more volume, you’ll have to connect a sound system using the 3.5mm audio jack or Bluetooth. Sadly, there is no ARC or eARC support.

 Lastly, unlike some of our other recommendations, it uses its own smart OS, which is based on Android, but you don’t get the whole Android TV experience, including Google Play Store access. The company has its own app store, and you can [manually install APK files](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/cover-film-noir-creating-vintage-scenes/), but there may be some compatibility issues.
