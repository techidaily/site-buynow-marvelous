## Watch Educational Video Lessons on Spotify's Latest Learning Platform!

Spotify is one of the best for music streaming, podcasts, and audiobooks, and now it's looking to mirror that success with online video learning courses. The new Spotify category is available starting today for subscribers in the UK.

 It's been a busy year for Spotify, from introducing a [new audiobook membership](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/overcoming-windows-update-failures-strategies-for-error-0x30017/) to releasing a [mini player for desktops](https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-messages-from-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-to-other-iphone-all-ios-versions-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/) and even [adding music videos](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-gain-an-edge-access-these-top-8-sites-for-free-eco-screen-backdrops-and-clips-for-2024/) to the platform. Online courses, or e-learning, may sound like an odd move for the company, but the hope is that many of the more than 600 million subscribers will want to take advantage of it and learn something new. In a blog post, the company said, "About half of Spotify Premium subscribers have engaged in education or self-help-themed podcasts," suggesting a strong demand for video learning content.

 More importantly, they'll be available to premium and free UK subscribers, with access to two video courses completely free. Then, to continue with a course, users can pay anywhere from £20 to £80\. So, what's available from Spotify's online video learning courses? In partnership with the BBC, Skillshare, and other third parties, over 100 courses are available with a wide variety of content, but much of it covers music recording, production, and songwriting.

 At least for now, the main four course categories are music, creativity, business, and healthy lifestyle content. Obviously, those are broad categories, so you'll be able to find other courses about starting a business, saving money, health and fitness, dancing, music and video production, cooking, photography, scaling a business, and much more.

 For now, Spotify video learning courses are only available in the UK, but we could see the new vertical expand to more regions in the near future. "Testing video courses in the UK allows us to explore an exciting opportunity to better serve the needs of our users who have an active interest in learning," said Babar Zafar, VP of Product Development at Spotify.

 You can access Spotify [e-learning courses on the web](https://courses.spotify.com/) or simply switch to the "Courses" tab on the mobile app. Pricing is the same for all users, whether they're a basic member or a premium subscriber.
