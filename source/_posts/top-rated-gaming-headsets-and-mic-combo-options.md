##  What to Look For in a Gaming Microphone in 2024

 While [gaming headsets](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/step-by-step-fixes-for-when-itunes-wont-recognize-your-iphone-on-windows-11/) are the most mainstream option for capturing audio while gaming, dedicated microphones are quickly becoming a popular alternative. These standalone products are typically much more powerful than the small mics built into headsets, allowing you to send crystal clear commands to your teammates. They're also wildly popular in the world of streaming, giving broadcasts a premium sense of production and improving the viewer's overall experience.

 There are a few things to consider before springing for the first microphone you come across on Amazon. The first question you need to ask yourself is how much audio mixing you want to deal with. Audio mixing allows you to adjust the volume and tone of your content, and it's a crucial feature for most live streamers and podcasters.

 If you only plan to use your microphone while gaming and aren't interested in streaming, you probably don't need this functionality. In that case, you can opt for a standard USB connection. But if you want the capability, you'll need to seek out something that utilizes XLR inputs and is compatible with your current setup.

 Streamers will also want to consider their microphone's overall design and adjustability. Not only will you need to feel comfortable while using your microphone, but you'll also want it to look good on camera. This could mean opting for something a bit more expensive with a high-end finish.

 Gamers simply using their microphone for online multiplayer have it easy---pick something affordable with a simple USB connection, and you're already ahead of what most standard headsets can achieve. But streamers need to be a bit more cautious about what they choose and ensure it'll mesh with the aesthetic they're looking to cultivate and will work with all their existing hardware and software.

| Pros                       | Cons                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✓ Impressive sound clarity | ✗ USB connection isn't ideal for high-end audio mixing |
| ✓ Reasonable price         |                                                        |

 Few gaming mics offer a better blend of pricing and performance than the [Blue Yeti X](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Professional-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B07QKQJL17?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204922&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F824556%2Fbest-gaming-microphone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The biggest drawback to the device is its USB connection---which makes for an easy setup, but doesn't give you the same deep audio mixing experience you'd get from an XLR input.

 The lack of mixing chops won't be an issue if you're just using it for gaming. Even casual streamers will be fine with what the Yeti X offers: crystal clear audio, a sleek design, and real-time LED metering to ensure your sound is coming through exactly as intended. It's also fully supported by Skype and Zoom, so it can pull double-duty as a work and play microphone.

 Premium sound quality isn't all you're getting with the Yeti X, as its four-capsule array is wrapped up in a high-end design that boasts a multi-function smart knob for easy adjustments, a built-in stand that lets you customize its positioning, and an understated black paint job that allows it to blend in with any streaming setup.

 If you are a gamer looking for a powerful gaming microphone that costs less than $100 and still delivers optimal sound, we recommend the [Razer Seiren V2 X USB Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Microphone-Supercardioid-Built/dp/B09GJXKYR4/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204922&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F824556%2Fbest-gaming-microphone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), an upgrade over the equally robust [Razer Seiren X](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Streaming-Microphone-Built/dp/B075HCLMYP/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204922&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F824556%2Fbest-gaming-microphone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Whether you’re on a voice chat with other gamers or with your friends while gaming, the Seiren V2 X ensures that your voice is heard, loud and clear.

 Not only does it produce crisp, clear vocals, but the Seiren V2 X also dampens vibrations, protecting your audience from knocks and bumps. Featuring a cardioid pickup pattern, this microphone is designed to eliminate ambient noise, ensuring that only focused sound from you comes through.

 Raxer's upgraded microphone features a physical mute button for when you want to pause a recording, as well as a gain button for controlling how loud or soft you sound. Using the Stream Mixer in the [Razer Synapse](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU204922&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fpc%2Fsoftware) app, you can independently adjust what you hear on your headphone monitor and what the audience hears from your microphone. 

 The Razer Seiren V2 X features a compact lightweight design with a desk stand base that allows it to be tilted at any convenient angle. You can even pair the Seiren V2 X with a [compatible boom arm and a pop filter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1724576-REG/razer%5Fseiren%5Fv2%5Fx%5Fusb.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU204922) to declutter your desk and keep out those unwanted popping sounds.

| Pros               | Cons                                                        |

| ✓ Dirt cheap       | ✗ Not compatible with Xbox                                  |
| ✓ Easy USB setup   | ✗ Underwhelming performance compared to others on this list |
| ✓ Adjustable stand |                                                             |

 Finding a good microphone under $30 isn't easy, but the [FIFINE Metal Condenser](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Condenser-Recording-Streaming-669B/dp/B06XCKGLTP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204922&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F824556%2Fbest-gaming-microphone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) does a serviceable job of improving your audio without breaking the bank. It also looks pretty sharp given its price tag, and looks surprisingly good during livestreams.

 The FIFINE is built with a USB connection, although Xbox consoles do not support it. Its performance is also in-line with what you'd expect from a $30 microphone, featuring cardioid pick instead of super cardioid---which means you'll get ambient sound in your broadcasts.

 If you can look beyond those drawbacks, there's much to love about the FIFINE. A built-in stand makes it easy to make small adjustments to its positioning, the USB connection makes setup a breeze, a volume knob lets you quickly change its settings, and it'll work just fine with apps like Discord and Twitch.

 It might be best to save up and [get something more future-proof](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-top-faces-essential-fb-videos/) if you're not looking for something immediately, but the FIFINE is great for gamers working with a smaller budget.

| Pros                                  | Cons        |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✓ USB and XLR connection              | ✗ Expensive |
| ✓ Easy-to-access touch panel controls |             |
| ✓ Premium sound clarity               |             |

 Aspiring streamers need a powerful microphone that lets them twist the mic's performance to their demands. The [Shure MV7 Podcast Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G7JN6J7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204922&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F824556%2Fbest-gaming-microphone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is more than up to the task, offering both USB and XLR connections that allow you to either get up and running in seconds for gaming or dive deep into the weeks for a lengthy streaming session.

 One of the coolest features of the Shure MV7 is its touch panel controls. These let you manipulate gain, monitoring volume, headphone mix, and mic muting without needing to wade through on-screen menus. They also accent the mic's premium look, which is built entirely from metal for added durability.

 To help you make the most of your sessions, you'll want to use the [ShurePlus MOTIV](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/software/shure%5Fplus%5Fmotiv%5Fdesktop) application. This lets you adjust a variety of variables related to your sound quality and even lets you apply filters. The software, combined with the mic's impressive pickup and clarity, makes it easy to sound like a professional even if you're streaming from a noisy home.

 The biggest drawback to the Shure MV7 is its price, which clocks in at $250\. You'll also need to buy a stand, as none are included in your purchase. But if you need something powerful for streaming, the MV7 is worth a closer look.

 While the [HyperX Cloud Alpha S](https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Alpha-Adjustable-Leatherette/dp/B081D8TPZZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204922&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F824556%2Fbest-gaming-microphone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn't offer the same powerful audio performance as a standalone microphone, it's a surprisingly capable headset that simplifies all your communication needs. Not only does it have a noise-canceling microphone, but its custom drivers pump out impressive sound to help bring every in-game explosion to life.

 HyperX is an increasingly popular choice for gaming peripherals, and few products in its lineup are as feature-complete as the Cloud Alpha S. Its wired connection won't be to everyone's taste, but it does allow for universal compatibility with today's most popular consoles (and PC) and makes it easy to get up and running in seconds.

 Oversized ear cushions, HyperX 7.1 Surround Sound, bass adjustment sliders, and an audio control mixer round out the offering. You'll also be treated to a flexible and removable microphone that makes it easy to communicate with your team---even if it's not as premium as a standalone mic. But considering you can get all this for around $100, the Cloud Alpha S is a great alternative to other products on this list.
