## Meta Quest 2 Endures At Unchanged Price of $199

The Meta Quest 2 standalone virtual reality headset was released in 2020, and now it serves as an entry-level option alongside the pricier Meta Quest 3\. Meta has now confirmed that the Quest 2 has received another permanent price drop.

 Meta announced today that the regular price for the [Quest 2 headset](https://amazon.com/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002771&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmeta-quest-2-price-drop-199%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) will stay at $199 in the United States. There was a limited sale at $150 [earlier this month](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-movie-buffs-secret-2023-recommendations/), and there will probably be other similar sales over the coming months, but $199 will be the typical price for the base 128GB model moving forward.

 The company said in a blog post, “From home fitness to fully immersive gaming to 2D entertainment, Meta Quest 2 is the most affordable way to tap into everything VR has to offer—and we’re doubling down by making our recent price drop permanent. That means, people can jump into VR with a 128GB Quest 2 headset for just $199 USD—no TV, console, battery pack, or wires required.”

 The Quest 2’s price tag has shifted several times since its introduction. It was originally priced at $300 for the 128GB model, and $400 for 256GB, then the prices for both were [raised by $100 in 2022](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-using-obs-for-gamers/). The price for the 256GB model [dropped in March 2023](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-adopt-the-best-practices-of-live-streaming-with-google-meet-youtube/) to $430, but the 128GB model remained at $400\. Both models returned to their original prices in June 2023, then they [dropped](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-6-ways-to-transfer-contacts-from-huawei-p60-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) to $250 for the 128GB model and $300 for the 256GB model in January. The Quest 3 still starts at $500.

 Even though the Quest 2 is still a great entry point for VR without spending too much money, we still don’t know how long it will be supported. The hardware is now four years old, with a lower screen resolution and more limited passthrough functionality than the Quest 3\. Meta started [winding down support for the original Quest headset](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhancing-your-contents-impact-smart-utilization-of-igtv-hashtags/) in 2023, only four years after its introduction. Hopefully, the much wider popularity and continued sales for the Quest 2 means it will stick around longer, but Meta hasn’t committed to anything.

 You can [buy the Quest 2 headset](https://amazon.com/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002771&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmeta-quest-2-price-drop-199%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) for $199 from Amazon, and it’s also available from [Meta](https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/), [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmeta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray%2F6473553.p%3FskuId%3D6473553), [Target](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmeta-quest-2-all-in-one-wireless-vr-headset-128gb%2F-%2FA-83984421), and other stores.
