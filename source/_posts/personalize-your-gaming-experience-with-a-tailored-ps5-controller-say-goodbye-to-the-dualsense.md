## Personalize Your Gaming Experience with a Tailored PS5 Controller – Say Goodbye to the DualSense

### Key Takeaways

* Custom PS5 controllers can improve gameplay and comfort but come at a higher price compared to standard DualSense controllers.
* Quality custom controllers can be found at retailers like SCUF Gaming, AimControllers, and ModdedZone with various customization options.
* The DualSense Edge by Sony also provides customizations similar to custom controllers with adjustable trigger heights and mappable back buttons.

 Sony's DualSense PS5 controller seems to be a hit with many, but it's certainly not for everyone. If you're not enjoying the DualSense, you can pick up a custom controller for a more enjoyable experience.

##  What Makes a Good Custom PS5 Controller?

Kris Henges / How-To Geek

 A good custom controller, whether for the PS5 or otherwise, should make your gaming experience better and more comfortable. After all, a third-party or custom PS5 controller will likely cost considerably more than a normal DualSense controller, so you want to get what you pay for. But this additional cost is worth it if [the issues you experience with Sony's default controller](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/chart-your-course-to-adventure-the-comprehensive-guide-to-vr-tours-for-2024/) stops you from enjoying your (even pricier) console.

 What that means, however, will be different for everyone. I personally needed a different solution to the DualSense's adaptive triggers since Sony's controller hurts my wrists, so I looked for a controller that let me set my own actuation point. Someone else may want a different button layout or additional buttons, so the best custom PS5 controller will fit your needs.

 As you likely suspect, you can change the look of a custom PS5 controller and find a color scheme you truly enjoy (instead of something you compromised with). From there, many custom retailers will offer Hall Effect triggers and bumpers, back buttons you can program, and joysticks of different heights and sizes.

 Whether you need the customization to lower hand strain or just because you like a special grip or joystick, customizing your own controller is the way to go.

##  Where Can I Get a Custom PS5 Controller?

Sergio Rodriguez / How-To Geek

 There are a few places you can pick up a quality PS5 controller. The most popular retailer is [SCUF Gaming](https://scufgaming.com/playstation5), which offers a variety of pre-built controllers and the ability to customize your own fully. [AimControllers](https://us.aimcontrollers.com/) also offers a variety of pre-made and custom-made controllers and is generally less expensive than SCUF, but SCUF offers more customization in terms of aesthetics. [ModdedZone](https://moddedzone.com/products/playstation-5-customizer) is a bit different in that they start with a DualSense and mod it from there, which can cut down a bit on costs, but also means you'll be more limited with some options.

 Alternatively, you can look for third-party controllers that meet your needs. For example, while the [PDP Victrix Pro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CRZ7KFKZ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004061&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdualsense-not-doing-it-for-you-get-a-custom-ps5-controller-instead%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is not something you can customize with the retailer, you'll get enough options out of the box to swap things out to your tastes. This includes joysticks of different heights, and sometimes even the ability to customize button layouts (like the Victrix Pro's Fightpad).

##  Be Prepared to Spend More on a Custom Controller

 If you want a custom controller, you'll need to be prepared to pay a premium price. The [DualSense](https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense%C2%AE-Wireless-Controller-Midnight-5/dp/B0CQKKHT5J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004061&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdualsense-not-doing-it-for-you-get-a-custom-ps5-controller-instead%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) retails at $69, which is no small amount, but custom controllers easily go above $100, and many can get past $200\. When I made a custom Reflex controller with SCUF, it was over $300 and didn't include all the bells and whistles. Meanwhile, the Victrix Pro is $180, but the controller is missing rumble features, which are standard in many controllers.

 It can be hard to justify the price if you think the DualSense is 'good enough'. You can easily buy two standard DualSense controllers for the price of one custom one. But if you're serious about your PS5 gameplay experience, it's worth the investment.

##  The DualSense Edge Feels Like a Custom Controller

Sony

 If figuring out what you want in a PS5 controller feels a little overwhelming, but you still want a better experience, you can get try Sony's own [DualSense Edge](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004061&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdualsense-not-doing-it-for-you-get-a-custom-ps5-controller-instead%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen). While pricey at $199, you'll get different stick modules and heights, mappable back buttons, and adjustable trigger heights. It's the [next best thing to a custom controller](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-unlock-your-google-pixel-8-by-drfone-android/).

 The DualSense Edge addresses most of the biggest complaints with the normal DualSense controller, but the cost can be hard to swallow, especially when many custom controllers are less expensive. Still, you pay for a premium for both the quality and convenience, and that can be worth it to anyone who finds the research too daunting and aren't quite sure what they want.

 There's no single [best game controller](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-computer-components-with-toms-gear-guides/) for every platform, you'll need to shop around to get something that works for you. If possible, take a look at controllers with [Hall Effect joysticks and triggers](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/esthetic-alignment-for-online-glamour-content-for-2024/), which should outlast traditional controllers that rely on potentiometers that will eventually break.
