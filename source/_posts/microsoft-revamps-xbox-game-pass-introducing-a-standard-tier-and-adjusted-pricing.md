## Microsoft Revamps Xbox Game Pass: Introducing a 'Standard' Tier & Adjusted Pricing

Game Pass allows you to play many different Xbox and PC games for one monthly subscription. It has been one of the best deals in gaming, but now Microsoft is changing prices and overhauling its plans.

 Microsoft previously offered three tiers of the [Game Pass](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-4-solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro/) subscription: Game Pass with basic online multiplayer and a small selection of games, Game Pass for Console with many Xbox games, PC Game Pass with many PC games, and Game Pass Ultimate with Xbox, PC, and cloud games. The newest entry was Game Pass Core, which [replaced Xbox Live Gold](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-frolics-of-fun-dissecting-the-goofy-movie/) and is required for most online multiplayer games on Xbox.

 Starting July 10, 2024, you can’t sign up for Game Pass for Console, but anyone who has it already can continue to use it. Microsoft is also rolling out new pricing for Game Pass Core and Game Pass Ultimate in all countries and currencies. In the United States, Game Pass Ultimate is jumping from $16.99/month to $19.99/month, while 12 months of Game Pass Core is increasing from $59.99/year to $74.99/year. Those updated prices are live now for new signups, and existing members will get the higher pricing starting September 12, 2024.

Microsoft

 The price hike is especially bad for Game Pass Core, because the subscription is required for online play in most Xbox games. If you have an Xbox, and you want to online multiplayer, you now need to pay at least $75/year—there’s no cheaper alternative. The [12-month subscription cards are still $60](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CMZ42J5K?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004089&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmicrosoft-overhauls-game-pass%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) at most retailers, though, so now is a good time to stock up. Sony charges $80/year for online multiplayer with [PlayStation Plus Essential](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/IP9101-PPSA06916%5F00-PLUS1T12M0000000), and most PC games have free online multiplayer.

 Microsoft is also introducing a new subscription tier, Game Pass Standard. It’s only for consoles, and includes all the features of Game Pass Core, but with more games included. Microsoft says the Standard subscription won’t get the “day one titles” from Game Pass Ultimate, so you’ll have to wait longer to play upcoming releases like _Indiana Jones and the Great Circle_ or _DOOM: The Dark Ages_. It also won’t have “specific entries to the Game Pass Ultimate library, access to EA Play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Perks, Quests, and discounts on games in the Game Pass library.”

 Game Pass Standard will be available for $14.99/month in the US “in the coming months.” That will be $5 less than Ultimate when it arrives. You can [sign up](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass#join) for Game Pass PC or Ultimate from the Xbox website.
