##  What to Look For in a Roku TV in 2023

 Apart from the platform built into the television set itself, [Roku smart TVs](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-smartphone-photography-with-iphones-hdr/) aren't that different from other televisions on the market. If you're looking for an excellent Roku TV, you want the television to be great in general and come with Roku built-in.

 Picture quality is one of the most important things to consider with any television. You want the television to offer a sharp and vibrant image with an excellent contrast ratio. As there are no [OLED](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) Roku TVs on the market, features like [quantum dot](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/how-to-do-time-lapse-on-samsung-phones/), [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/), and [Mini-LED](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) have become very important. These technologies help [LED TVs](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-unraveling-untethered-art-top-public-domain-gems-for-2024/) improve their picture performance multi-fold.

 If you are buying a Roku TV for gaming, there are additional features that you need to look for, like low input lag, fast response time, [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) support, and [variable refresh rate](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) (VRR). These ensure you get a fantastic gaming experience and that your TV is future-proof.

 Budget and TV size also play a significant role in your purchase decision. As such, our recommendations include the best Roku TVs for a variety of budgets. For screen size, we have [a handy guide](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-counter-image-navigation-in-digital-age-a-facebook-guide/) to help you figure out the right TV size for your room.

##  Best Roku TV Overall: [Roku Plus Series](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-55-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536733.p) 

![roku plus series tv](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/roku-plus-series-tv.jpg) 

Roku

| Pros                            | Cons                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Excellent picture quality       | No advanced gaming features |
| Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support |                             |

 As TCL hasn’t introduced any new mid-range or high-end Roku TV models in 2023 and doesn’t seem to be restocking the older models, the Roku TV selection is pretty slim. So, if you want the best Roku TV in 2023, Roku’s own [Plus Series](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-55-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536733.p) is your best option. It’s an excellent 4K mid-range television that delivers a great picture overall, thanks to the assistance of quantum dots and full-array local dimming.

 The TV also shines in terms of its coverage of the DCI-P3 color space at over 95%. So you’ll get accurate color in HDR. Speaking of HDR, the Plus Series supports both [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) and [HDR10+](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/).

 Additionally, as it comes from Roku itself, the Plus Series offers a seamless implementation of the Roku experience. The interface is smooth and easy to use. You also have private listening support and more. Although the TV lacks advanced gaming features, such as a 120Hz panel and VRR, Roku has ensured gamers will get low input lag, along with [Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM)](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/) support.

 You can buy the Roku Plus Series in [55-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-55-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536733.p), [65-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-65-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536734.p), and [75-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-75-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536735.p) sizes.

Best Roku TV Overall

#####  Roku Plus Series

Enjoy impressive 4K picture, Dolby Vision HDR, and Roku’s easy-to-use software in the company’s Plus Series TV. It’s also a good option for casual gaming.

[See at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-65-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536734.p)

![roku select series](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/roku-select-series.jpg) 

Roku

| Pros                      | Cons                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| HDR10+ support            | Lacks advanced gaming features       |
| Low input lag and ALLM    | No local dimming or Dolby Vision HDR |
| Multiple sizes under $500 |                                      |

 Don’t have the budget for the Roku Plus Series? Don’t worry. The company offers a step-down model in the form of the [Select Series](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-55-class-select-series-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536725.p), which is more affordable. Although it doesn’t have the fancier technologies such as quantum dots or full-array local dimming, the TV produces a decent picture. It won’t be able to compete with more expensive TVs, but for its price tag, the visual performance of the Select Series won’t disappoint you.

 The Roku Select Series TV is compatible with HDR and can display HDR10+ and [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) signals without any trouble. Plus, you get four HDMI ports, including one that supports [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/).

 In other highlights, casual gamers will also be happy with the Select Series as it has a low input lag for a responsive gaming experience and can automatically switch to the [Game Mode](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-much-income-arises-from-each-snapshot-video-for-2024/) thanks to ALLM support. But as you can expect, Roku had to make a few sacrifices to reach the lower price tag of the Select Series. The TV not only lacks the advanced gaming features like the Plus Series, but it also doesn’t have Dolby Vision support.

 You can buy the 4K Roku Select Series TV in a variety of sizes from [43 inches](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-43-class-select-series-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536712.p) to [75 inches](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-75-class-select-series-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536730.p), with only the biggest size going beyond the $500 threshold.

Best Roku TV Under $500

#####  Roku Select TV

The Select Series is Roku’s affordable version of the Plus Series. It has 4K resolution, HDR10+ support, and a low input lag for gaming.   

[See at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-55-class-select-series-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536725.p) 

##  Best Roku TV Under $300: [Hisense 43R6E3](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hisense-43-Class-4K-UHD-LED-Roku-Smart-TV-HDR-43R6E3/213300402) 

[](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hisense-43-Class-4K-UHD-LED-Roku-Smart-TV-HDR-43R6E3/213300402)

[![Hisense 43R6E3 on pink background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hisense-43R6E3.jpg) Hisense](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hisense-43-Class-4K-UHD-LED-Roku-Smart-TV-HDR-43R6E3/213300402)

[](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hisense-43-Class-4K-UHD-LED-Roku-Smart-TV-HDR-43R6E3/213300402) 

| Pros                                       | Cons                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Good native contrast ratio and deep blacks | Low HDR brightness  |
| Dolby Vision and HDR10 support             | Average performance |
| Excellent value for money                  |                     |

 The [Hisense 43R6E3](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hisense-43-Class-4K-UHD-LED-Roku-Smart-TV-HDR-43R6E3/213300402) is one of the most affordable 4K Roku TVs on the market. If you're looking for an inexpensive Roku television for a guest room or a dorm room, it's your best bet.

 The television looks decent and has narrow bezels, but apart from that, it's mostly a practical design. Thanks to the TV's VA panel, its native contrast ratio is good, and the company has also included Dolby Vision and HDR10 support. However, the 43R6E3 doesn't get bright enough to use the HDR support effectively.

 Still, the 43R6E3 offers a decent viewing experience for its price tag, and you won't be disappointed. As expected, there are no advanced gaming features, but Hisense has included a game mode that offers relatively low input lag and okay response time.

 If you can spend more money, the [TCL 43S435](https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208385&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F760144%2Fbest-roku-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is another excellent budget Roku TV. It has an MSRP of $349, but you can get it for as low as $290\. The TV offers an excellent contrast ratio and can display deep blacks, which is an upgrade from Hisense's set. If you can wait until the TCL model is on sale, you won't regret it.

Best Roku TV Under $300

#####  Hisense 43R6E3

The Hisense 43R6E3 is a good option for anyone looking for an inexpensive Roku TV. It costs less than $300 and provides a decent viewing experience.

##  Best Roku TV For Gaming: [Hisense U6GR](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhisense-55-class-u6gr-series-quantum-uled-4k-uhd-smart-roku-tv%2F6502597.p) 

![hisenseu6gr](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hisense-u6gr.jpg) 

Hisense

| Pros                            | Cons                             |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| VRR support and low input lag   | Trouble displaying 480p signals  |
| Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support | No 120Hz panel or HDMI 2.1 ports |
| Good picture quality            |                                  |

 Although a slightly older TV, the [Hisense U6GR](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhisense-55-class-u6gr-series-quantum-uled-4k-uhd-smart-roku-tv%2F6502597.p) is a great 4K model that comes with baked-in Roku OS. And thanks to its low input lag, support for VRR, and ALLM, it’s a good option for gaming.

 The TV also shines on the picture quality front as Hisense uses a VA-type LCD panel with full-array local dimming. So the TV’s already good black levels get enhanced, and you get an excellent contrast ratio. The vibrant and lifelike colors from the U6GR’s quantum dot layer pop on it, making watching movies and playing games a treat.

 Other features include support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, giving you access to most HDR content. Moreover, the U6GR is good at [upscaling](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/) 720p or 1080p content but [struggles with 480p](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/u6gr). Additionally, as the Hisense U6GR is missing a 120Hz panel, it’s not a suitable television for anyone wanting to enjoy high-refresh-rate gaming. But as the only Roku TV with a 120Hz panel—the [TCL 6 Series R655](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-65-class-6-series-4k-mini-led-uhd-qled-dolby-vision-hdr-smart-roku-tv%2F6515360.p)—is pretty hard to find, your best alternative will be to pick one of the [best gaming TV picks](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-visionvoice-tips-for-perfectly-sized-insta-posts/) and use a [Roku streaming stick](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/2E834561-AD18-49ED-92A1-140A0A8B1919?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208385&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F760144%2Fbest-roku-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) to get the Roku experience.

 Otherwise, the Hisense U6GR is an all-around good gaming Roku TV with a few missing features. You can buy it in [55-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhisense-55-class-u6gr-series-quantum-uled-4k-uhd-smart-roku-tv%2F6502597.p) and [65-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhisense-65-class-u6gr-series-quantum-uled-4k-uhd-smart-roku-tv%2F6485674.p) models.

 After years of working with TV manufacturers like Hisense and TCL to release Roku TVs, the company introduced its [first self-branded TVs in 2023](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-sony-xperia-10-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). And its [Plus Series](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-65-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536734.p) televisions are pretty great for a first attempt. Sitting at the top of Roku's TV lineup, the Plus Series packs nearly all the bells and whistles you need for a fantastic movie-watching experience.

 It has a 4K LCD panel with quantum dot technology and full-array local dimming. As a result, you get a vibrant picture and deep blacks. HDR is also available, supporting Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and HDR10\. Plus, the TV gets bright enough for a decent HDR experience.

 Another highlight of the Roku Plus Series is its sound quality. Unlike most modern televisions that pack average speakers and often need a soundbar or speaker system for excellent audio, the Roku TV offers a decent audio experience with rich sound.

 Other features include four HDMI ports, including one for eARC. Dolby Atmos support is also present, and the Plus Series has decent upscaling for lower-resolution content.

 Sadly, the Roku Plus Series is not without flaws. One significant issue with the Roku Plus Series is its [inability to remove judder](https://reviewed.usatoday.com/televisions/content/roku-plus-series-qled-tv-review).

The TCL TV is more expensive, but you get better picture quality and gaming performance. However, the TCL model has trouble upscaling 480p content.
