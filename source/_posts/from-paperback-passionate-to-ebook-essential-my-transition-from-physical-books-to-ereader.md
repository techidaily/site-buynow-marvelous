## From Paperback Passionate to EBook Essential: My Transition From Physical Books to eReader

### Key Takeaways

* eReaders are more convenient than physical books for traveling and are easier to pull out and dip into at any time.
* Carrying an eReader means having thousands of books on you, so I can always find a book that fits my mood.
* By shopping for deals or getting a subscription, an eReader can save you money on books.

 Once upon a time, I was a die-hard physical books fan. But when I went traveling, I couldn't lug heavy books around with me, so I did something I never thought I would: I bought an eReader. Now, my opinion has been radically changed and I use my eReader all the time. Here's what I love about it.

##  eReaders Are Far More Convenient Than Physical Books

 I knew carrying multiple paperbacks (or, God forbid, hardbacks) would become very annoying, very quickly while traveling, but I hadn't realized just how convenient eReaders would prove to be. While they do range in size, most eReaders can fit in a small bag or even a pocket, making them easy to take anywhere and read on the fly.

 I keep my eReader in my backpack, where it takes up no space at all, and can easily get it out on public transport or when sitting on a park bench to read a few pages.

##  Carrying a Library in My Pocket Gives Me So Much Choice

 eReaders can store [thousands of books](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/optimal-audio-on-ios-the-essentials-of-podcasting-for-2024/) at once, so there's a very high chance that I'll always have something I fancy reading. No matter your mood, having the equivalent of a whole library in your pocket gives you so much choice.

 With physical books, I would often find I wasn't in the mood for the paperback I had on me. But now, I can instantly switch to a new ebook, and I always have something I fancy reading with me.

##  Owning an eReader Can Save You Money on Books

 After the initial cost of [buying an eReader](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/superior-10-mobile-apps-to-edit-your-face/), which is still much less than a regular tablet, the price of ebooks is significantly lower than the price of new physical books. If you keep your eyes peeled, digital stores also have lots of sales, where you can stock up on cheap ebooks to save for a later date.

 Many eReader companies, including Kindle and Kobo, even have [subscription models](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/msi-unveils-top-tier-z890-and-b8n60-boards-for-intel-arc-s-certified-before-the-excitement-of-computex-2024-begins/) that may be a more cost-effective way of getting books, if you're a voracious reader.

 There are also loads of places online where you can get [free ebooks legally](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-advanced-vr-tech-for-drone-enthusiasts/). And if you sign up for your local library, they may have an online catalog that lets you [borrow library books](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/) straight onto your eReader.

##  My Reading Style Is Different When I Use an eReader

 In the past, I didn't see a need for ebooks or audiobooks in my life. I felt I needed to clutch a book in my hands, feel its weight, and flick through its pages to have a fulfilling reading experience. Well, I was right in thinking eReaders would offer a different reading experience, but I was wrong in thinking that it would necessarily be worse.

 With a physical book in my hands, I get more immersed and read for longer stints, often speeding through the book fairly quickly. Whereas I find eReaders are better for reading whenever I have a spare minute, reading books in smaller chunks over a longer period of time.

 I enjoy both reading styles. And, although I thought it would be a disjointed reading experience, I actually like that my ebook reading style gives me longer to digest a book and feel its impact. Instead of racing through a book, I savor it, and I find that sometimes this helps a book stay with me longer.

##  I Still Enjoy Physical Books Alongside My eReader

 So here I am, confessing that I am a convert. But my love for eReaders hasn't diminished my love for physical books. Now, I generally have both a physical book and an ebook on the go at any one time because they fulfill different needs for me. I still get the immersive experience of sitting down with a chunky hardback and getting lost in it, but I also get the advantages of an eReader that I can dip into at convenient moments.

 While my eReader won't fully replace physical books for me, it has certainly carved out a niche that compliments what I already had. So it is official: my eReader is here to stay.
