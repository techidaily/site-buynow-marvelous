## Discover the Leading Mesh Wireless Networks for 2N4

 If you live in a larger house, you may notice some areas in your home suffer poor connectivity. This is where[mesh Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178) network systems come into play, using multiple units to extend the Wi-Fi network. One is designated as the central unit and connects to your Internet service. You can then place one or more satellite units to cover areas the primary one can't reach.

 Pros

* Affordable Wi-Fi 6 technology
* Small footprint
* Great range

 Cons

* No dedicated backhaul channel
* No USB ports

 TP-Link has built a reputation for itself recently with some surprisingly affordable Wi-Fi 6 routers, and the Deco X20 is no exception. This small but mighty mesh system represents a way to get into[Wi-Fi 6 technology](https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345) without emptying your wallet.

 The X20 is a good choice for users who need broad coverage, with three units handling homes of up to 5,800 square feet. The[dual-band](https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279) AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 support offers a comfortable 1.8Mbps bandwidth, although this is only partially on par with some of the pricier alternatives in this list.

 But more importantly, the Deco X20 lacks the dedicated backhaul channel on more advanced mesh Wi-Fi systems. This means it may not perform as well on busy and heavily congested home networks — those with a dozen or more devices gaming, video calling, and streaming in 4K—but it should be more than enough for the online needs of smaller families.

 The Deco X20 is a breeze to set up, thanks to TP-Link’s aptly named Deco app, which can help even the most inexperienced home networking users get up and running within a few minutes. It also includes TP-Link’s new HomeCare security suite, powered by Trend Micro. It offers anti-malware features and parental controls to keep your home network safe against intruders and kids away from the internet's darker corners. Each unit includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect non-wireless devices, but sadly, there aren’t any USB ports for sharing external storage devices.

[$225 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769)

 Pros

* Fast and reliable coverage
* Easy to set up
* Highly configurable

 Cons

* USB ports don't support shared storage

 Netgear’s Orbi strikes an almost perfect balance of performance, price, and features among mesh Wi-Fi systems. With only two units, Orbi can provide fast and stable Wi-Fi over an area of up to 5,000 square feet, and this range can be easily extended by adding additional units.

 Netgear promises that Orbi can deliver at least 150Mbps anywhere in your home, which was more than evident in our testing. You’ll enjoy smooth online performance throughout your living space without worrying about buffering[Netflix 4K UHD](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830) streams or stuttering[Zoom calls](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476) .

 Orbi accomplishes this by dedicating the fastest of its three Wi-Fi bands as a backhaul channel. Remember that in a mesh network, data to or from your device may pass from one access point to the following multiple times before it reaches your router and moves on to your[Internet Service Provider](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) network. The backhaul channel provides dedicated bandwidth for this pass-through traffic, ensuring you’ll get the same excellent wireless performance whether your devices are closer to the central unit or one of the satellite units.

 This also makes the collection of four Gigabit Ethernet ports found on each unit even more helpful, as you can plug in things like a TV and not see a drop in speed. Each also has a USB 2.0 port for sharing printers around your home. The partnership between Netgear and Circle with Disney offers advanced security and parental controls.

 Pros

* Tri-band Wi-Fi 6
* Expansive coverage
* Affordable

 Cons

* Requires mobile app for initial set up
* Not good for multi-gigabit broadband
* Lacks advanced features

 When getting maximum coverage out of your mesh Wi-Fi system, Linksys’ Velop system will give you the best bang for your buck. The MX 12600 bundle includes three identical Wi-Fi 6 capable AX4200 mesh units (three times 4,200 is 12,600, see?) for less than most other systems charge for only two. This means solid and reliable performance for homes of up to 8,100 square feet at an affordable price.

 You’ll designate one of these units as the primary router that hosts your broadband connection, then place the other two wherever you need the best and strongest coverage in your home. The Velop system also features a “dynamic” backhaul channel: The system intelligently decides which of the three Wi-Fi bands is best suited to move traffic between the mesh stations and which should be available for your Wi-Fi clients.

 Each unit also includes four Gigabit Ethernet ports, letting you hardwire in non-Wi-Fi devices. And thanks to a high-speed USB 3.2 port on the back of each unit, you can connect multiple hard drives or other storage devices for sharing files or even streaming media.

 Linksys’ mobile app also makes the system a cinch to set up, walking you through getting the first unit online and then joining the other two into a single mesh network. Although you’ll need to use the mobile app for the initial configuration, you can manage the system from the more familiar web interface once the mesh has been configured.

 The MX12600 system offers all the basic networking features you’d expect from a modern router, including elementary Quality of Service (QoS) support (which prioritizes devices based on the type of service they’re using. There are rudimentary parental controls, but they should be enough for most typical users. However, those hoping for advanced features like a built-in[VPN server](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-vpn-5189778) or online malware protection will want to look elsewhere.

 Pros

* Blazing fast performance
* Excellent range
* 2.5Gbps WAN port

 Cons

* Very expensive
* Lacks some advanced features
* No USB ports

 Thanks to its use of Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax technology, the AX6000 is one of the fastest mesh network solutions available, even when you have a lot of devices on your network; the much higher network capacity offered by Wi-Fi 6 means it can easily handle up to 100 devices without breaking a sweat.

 The Orbi system offers 6Gbps of total bandwidth, and we found it can maintain these impressive speeds even at the edges of its range. Since a two-unit system will give you 5,000 square feet of Wi-Fi coverage (which can be expanded by adding up to five more satellite units), you'll be sure to see consistently fast speeds anywhere in your home.

 Netgear has also packed in four Gigabit Ethernet ports on each station, so you'll have plenty of room for wiring in devices like game consoles for maximum performance. The main router on this higher-end model also offers a high-speed 2.5Gbps[Wide Area Network (WAN)](https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383) port to ensure you're ready for the fastest home broadband connections.

 One disappointing aspect of Netgear's newer Wi-Fi 6 solution is the omission of the USB ports found in earlier Orbi versions. The lack of advanced configuration settings may also let power users down compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers. But if you want to maintain the best performance possible, even if it means sacrificing some network management features, this is the mesh system for you.

 Pros

* Lots of advanced features
* Parental and security controls

 Cons

* Expensive

 Although Asus' AiMesh technology will let you join almost any combination of Asus routers to form a mesh network, the company's ZenWiFi XT8 takes that further. It's a "mesh-first" system that works right out of the box to give you maximum coverage and performance throughout your home with minimum fuss. The Asus mobile app makes it so easy to set up you won't even notice how much power it packs under the hood.

 The ZenWifi XT8 offers cutting-edge 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 technology and packs many gaming enhancements that have become synonymous with Asus routers. The[low latency](https://www.lifewire.com/latency-on-computer-networks-818119) means you'll get lag-free performance in your favorite online games. While the ZenWiFi system lacks the full suite of game optimization features found on[Asus' ROG routers](https://www.lifewire.com/best-asus-routers-4159861) , it still includes the adaptive QoS feature to boost gaming traffic.

 A single ZenWiFi unit can cover up to 2,750 square feet by itself, so each one you add increases that accordingly, meaning a standard two-pack is good for up to 5,500 square feet. Even better, Asus' AiMesh technology means you can easily add other Asus router models or the ZenWiFi system to your existing wired Asus router.

So, it’s an especially great choice for anyone already invested in the Google ecosystem. You can issue voice commands to control smart appliances, check the weather, send messages, and set up calendar appointments.

 Three units—the central base station and two points—provide up to 5,400 square feet of coverage. Google’s Home and Wi-Fi apps make this an absolute cinch to set up and manage. It even lets you set up a guest network for your friends and other visitors and let them get online simply by[scanning a QR code](https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658) .

 The main downside to Nest Wi-Fi is that the base station includes only one Ethernet LAN port, and you won’t find any at all on the satellite points, so you’ll need to add your[network hub](https://www.lifewire.com/ethernet-and-network-hubs-816358) if you want to hardwire in some of your devices at the router. And if you need to wire in devices at the points, you’ll want to look elsewhere.

 Additionally, the Nest doesn’t support the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard like some of the other systems here, so if you need maximum performance or are a stickler for future-proofing your network, the Nest may not be the best option.

 Pros

* Strong, consistent connection
* Sleek Design
* Great range

 Cons

* Lacks some basic settings
* Some features cost extra

 Linksys' first whole home Wi-Fi system, the Velop Tri-Band AC6600, is one of the more attractive designs we've seen. Each sleek white node is roughly the size of a tower of Jenga blocks, and they look nice enough to sit on display rather than being hidden away. Linksys sells Velop nodes individually or in packs of two or three; each will give you about 2,000 square feet of coverage. So, a complete system can blanket a 6,000-square-foot home.

 The Velop AC6600 system includes tri-band Wi-Fi and dedicates the second 5GHz band as a backhaul channel. This means it can keep traffic moving smoothly between all units for maximum performance throughout your home, even if one is under heavy usage. The downside is that your devices won't be able to take advantage of the extra 5GHz band, so even though each of these AC2200 routers can theoretically provide 2,134Mbps of throughput, only 1,267Mbps of that total is available to your devices.

 The Velop offers a simplified setup process thanks to the Linksys smartphone app. However, if you like to tinker with your network settings, you'll probably want to look elsewhere since it has limited configuration options. There's also no malware protection, and parental controls are confined to blocking websites and manually restricting internet access from specific devices.

## What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network

 Every wireless router, no matter how many antennas it has or how powerful it is, suffers from the same issue: radio signals weaken when they pass through walls, floors, and other obstructions. Mesh Wi-Fi network systems are designed to solve this problem by placing a number of nodes throughout your home or business, creating a uniformly strong signal with no dead spots.

 Unlike traditional routers with wireless extenders and access points, mesh systems are designed from the ground up to work as a node-based system. Setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network system is typically a lot easier than connecting range extenders to an existing system, and they automatically pass your connection from one node to the next as you move around your home.

 The main drawback of mesh Wi-Fi network systems is the price, as they tend to be more expensive than traditional routers. You can typically buy a nice router and some extenders for less than a mesh Wi-Fi starter kit, but if your situation really calls for a mesh system, it’s well worth the additional investment.

### Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?

 Most mesh Wi-Fi network systems support a single[smart home](https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-connected-home-817684) integration system, and a few support more than one.[Alexa](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107) is the most commonly supported, with integration from manufacturers like Eero, Linksys, Netgear, and more. Philips Hue,[IFTTT](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ifttt-4172417) , and others see less integration.

 If you already have some smart devices in your home, and you’re already tied into either the Alexa or[Google Home](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-home-and-how-does-it-work-4801919) ecosystem, then that should inform your decision regarding which mesh Wi-Fi network system to choose, but keep in mind that you don't technically need your router to support your smart home assistant unless you need to be able to control its features with voice commands, such as enabling your guest network or blocking access to your kids' devices.

 If you're an Apple HomeKit user, then the iPhone maker has taken a different approach. You won't find any routers that can be controlled via Siri, however, a few mesh systems are adding HomeKit-specific security features to keep your smart home devices protected from network intrusions, which is something that neither Google Home nor Amazon Alexa yet offers.

### Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs

 Since mesh systems are high-end equipment, they typically include robust security options and parental controls. There are a handful of systems that don’t include either, so look for those if you don’t have kids and prefer to manage security on individual devices.

 The most important thing to check in this area is whether or not the security and parental controls of the mesh system you’re interested in require a subscription. Basic security options are often free, but the best-advanced protections and parental controls often come at the cost of an ongoing monthly subscription, so make sure to take that into account.  
  
 FAQ

* What’s the difference between a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi extender?  
 Mesh Wi-Fi systems and Wi-Fi extenders extend the reach of your wireless signal beyond your main router’s range. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are more tightly integrated, with the main and satellite devices expressly designed to work in concert.
* Are mesh Wi-Fi systems faster?  
 Technically speaking, a mesh Wi-Fi system won’t offer better performance than an equivalent standalone router when you’re sitting right beside it. Since speed always falls off due to a weaker signal as you move farther away from your router, mesh systems can make a difference in larger homes.
* Do you need to replace your existing router?  
 In most cases, the answer is yes. Although some mesh Wi-Fi systems can work with existing routers, you’ll generally get better performance and a much better user experience if you use a full mesh Wi-Fi system. If you’re a cable internet subscriber, you’ll still need to hang onto your cable modem.
* How fast is a mesh Wi-Fi system?  
 Since mesh Wi-Fi network systems are uniformly high-end, they are also pretty fast. If your home internet connection isn’t very fast, then there isn’t any benefit to choosing a speedier mesh system over a slower one. You can check your internet connection speed with[free speed tests](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-test-sites-2626177) if you aren’t sure what it is.
