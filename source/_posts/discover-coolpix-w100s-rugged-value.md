 The 5th-generation iPad Air is a fantastic Apple tablet I own. It's fast and lightweight, with a beautiful screenâ€“what more could you ask for in a travel companion?

## Amazon Kindle

 If you want a specialized e-reader rather than using an iPad to read, Amazon's latest Kindle is the way to go. It has an easy-to-read 6-inch screen even in bright light, and it weighs just under 6 ounces (the iPhone 15 weighs a tad more.)

## Apple AirTag

 Misplacing your belongings stinks, especially when traveling. Apple's AirTags can take away some of that stress, and with iOS 17, you can share them with up to five people to track shared belongings.

 When I'm traveling, I'm always worried about running out of juice in my various devices, and carrying around a million cords and adapters is a nightmare. (You should see my bag o' wires.) The Satechi Duo Charger offers wireless and wired charging in a relatively small package. It lets you charge up to three devices at once.

 If you decide to bring that big bag o' wires, consider getting kit with organizing pockets (I'm considering it!) The Bellroy Tech Kit has a bunch of pockets and elastic loops to keep everyting secure and organized.

 Fuji's Instax Mini 11 camera comes in several spring colors and quickly prints out your snapshots on the go. It even has a selfie button. Instant cameras are always a novel way to commemorate an event or trip.
