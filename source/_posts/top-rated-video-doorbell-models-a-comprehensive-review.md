##  What to Look for in a Video Doorbell in 2023

 Installing a video doorbell is one of the best ways to help secure your home. It mostly works the same as a [home security camera](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhance-your-game-experience-with-these-5-screen-capture-techniques-for-minecraft-mac/), except it's designed for your front door. Unwanted visitors will think twice about breaking in when they see a doorbell camera in front of them.

 So, how do you choose the right video doorbell for you? With so many options on the market, it all depends on what you're looking for.

 Doorbell cameras come with a wide variety of features, including two-way audio, high-resolution video, motion detection, sending instant alerts to your phone, and night vision. You can find video doorbells with premium features such as 3:4 aspect ratio lenses to see visitors from head-to-toe and compatibility with voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant.

 You usually have two options when installing video doorbells. The first is hardwiring them with your existing doorbell. This option is ideal for those who don't ever want to worry about battery life.

 The second is wirelessly installing the doorbell at your front door using the tools provided with the camera. Of course, you'll need to recharge or replace the battery in the video doorbell when it's low or runs out.

 The last factors you'll want to consider are storage and app control. If you're going to store a lot of footage for long periods, you'll need a subscription service. These services usually allow you to save plenty of footage in the cloud.

 Most devices with local storage don't include much built-in storage, so you'll have to empty the saved videos frequently. You may also favor having full control of your video doorbell through an app since it's convenient to use.

 Now that you know what to look for, let's go over the best options on the market.

 Ring video doorbells have firmly cemented their place as the market leader over the past several years, and perhaps rightly so. With innovative features, quality construction, and a range of devices that match most situations and budgets, what's not to like? And sitting right at the top of the Ring range is the [Video Doorbell Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Pro-2/dp/B086Q54K53?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208124&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764714%2Fbest-video-doorbell%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). 

 Video and images captured by the Pro 2 doorbell camera have an exceptional 1536p resolution through a wide-angle lens. That means crisp and clear head-to-toe pictures of anyone standing at your door. You also get full-color night vision and video pre-roll to help ensure you always know who is approaching your property. 

 Motion detection can be set for up to 30ft. That's perfect for all but the most massive front lawns, but for even more security overwatch, the Pro 2 also has Birds-Eye View. This feature, available on only this Ring doorbell, uses radar technology to track the route someone takes through your yard, even if they have already left the camera's field of view. 

 Audio options are also better than almost any other video doorbell. Two-way audio and noise-canceling let you talk and listen to callers through the Ring app for iOS or Android. And if you aren't available to talk, linking with Alexa allows you to set up pre-recorded messages. 

 One of the potential downsides is the fact that there is no battery version of the Pro 2 available, meaning it has to be wired in. If you already have wiring in place for a traditional doorbell, it shouldn't be a problem. However, the extra installation complexity should be considered if you plan on wiring it in from scratch. There is a version that includes a chime box and adapter for an electrical outlet, but it does cost more. 

 The Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 is undeniably at the top end of the price range but has a collection of premium features that are difficult to find elsewhere.

Ring

| Pros                                           | Cons                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Affordable                                     | Requires a wired connection |
| Captures 1080p footage                         |                             |
| Excellent integration with Alexa and Ring apps |                             |

 Despite a price tag that often dips below $50 during Amazon's sales events, the [Ring Video Doorbell Wired](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CKHPP52?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208124&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764714%2Fbest-video-doorbell%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is packed with features. It's also sleek-looking, with a black chassis and the iconic blue "ring" button making it look like a much more premium product than it is.

 Inside that chassis, you'll find a camera that records in 1080p and software that easily integrates with the Alexa and Ring ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208124/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ringapp) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ring-always-home/id926252661)) apps. And as you'd find on doorbells with a much larger price tag, the Ring Video Doorbell Wired offers two-way audio, night vision, and access to [Ring Protect](https://ring.com/protect-plans) plans that allow you to store footage for up to 180 days.

 Its wired connection means you'll need to be comfortable disconnecting your old unit and attaching a few cables to your new video doorbell—something that not everyone will want to do. However, the installation process is worth the hassle for its continuous power supply, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a more capable doorbell in this price range.

| Motion detection alerts included without a subscription |                                                        |

 If you're not excited about signing up for a monthly subscription, consider checking out the [Arlo Essential Doorbell](https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-AVD2001-100NAS-Essential-Doorbell-Wire-Free/dp/B08HRNG8CR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208124&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764714%2Fbest-video-doorbell%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Most doorbells (including this one) lock many features behind a paywall, but at least the Arlo Essential Doorbell gives you incredible performance straight out of the box.

 Almost all video doorbells can capture HD footage, but few match the 4K resolution offered by Arlo. Not only does this mean you'll have crisp video to review, but you'll be able to zoom in and pick out far-away details with ease. Two-way talk and audio are also included free without a subscription, as are motion detection alerts and access to the smartphone app.

 Those are impressive features, but as is always the case, signing up for a monthly subscription can be tempting. The ability to set activity zones, store up to 30 days of footage, and receive specific notifications based on what has triggered your camera are all enticing reasons to spring for the $3/month Arlo Secure subscription.

 But if you just need the basics, there's no better way to get them than with the Arlo Essential Doorbell.

The [Google Nest Doorbell](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery-snow%2F6473256.p%3FskuId%3D6473256) is your best bet, and it's priced reasonably. This popular camera is an upgraded version of the wired one, and it's a great bet for many.

 Although the nest doorbell is battery-operated, you can still hook it up to your existing doorbell for constant power if you want. If you choose to go wireless, it's easy to install, and the battery life lasts for six months, which is great. This is a relatively long time of not having to worry about a recharge.

 The Nest Doorbell records 1600x1200 HD video with a 165-degree lens, a larger field of view than most doorbell cameras. It also uses a 3:4 aspect ratio to see from head to toe. Combined with the large field of view, you can observe everything that's going on around your front door.

 The camera captures video in [HDR](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) and with [night vision](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/tailoring-soundtracks-for-impact-in-canva-videos/), allowing you to see clearly during the day and at night. The sensors can differentiate between people, packages, animals, and vehicles to send you specific motion alerts of what's going on at your door. You'll receive instant alerts on your phone so that you can answer in real-time or leave pre-set messages.

 The Nest Doorbell is the perfect addition for [Google Home](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-proven-methods-to-supercharge-your-spotify-ad-results/) owners as you can integrate and control it from the Google Home app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208124/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-home/id680819774). Nest offers an additional feature of up to an hour of video recording should your Wi-Fi power shut off. You can also see what you missed for up to three hours of free event video history.

 If three hours of event history isn't long enough, you can upgrade to the [Nest Aware](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest%5Faware?hl=en-US) subscription to save up to 60 days of event history. The subscription starts at $8/month, allowing you to record continuously and enabling the camera to recognize familiar faces.

### How do I install a video doorbell?

### Is there a video doorbell that doesn't require Wi-Fi?

 Although you might be able to find video doorbells that don't require Wi-Fi, few of them are worth your time and money. Wi-Fi provides access to a slew of remote features, and many of the best products on the market require this wireless connection.

### Are there smart locks that work with video doorbells?

 Yes. Some manufacturers incorporate both products into one (such as Lockly), while others can provide access to your smart lock while using your video doorbell's smartphone app (such as August).

### How much is the average cost of a video doorbell subscription?

 Basic plans that offer services for a single doorbell typically cost less than $5/month, although advanced plans that offer services for multiple devices (along with professional monitoring services) can run upwards of $20/month.

### Should I buy a wired or wireless video doorbell?

 If your home is already equipped with a wired connection, then a wired video doorbell is a smart choice as you'll never need to worry about changing the batteries. However, wireless video doorbells tend to be easier to set up and are a great option for all households.
