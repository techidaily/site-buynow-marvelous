##  What to Look for in an Action Camera in 2023

 One of the most important things to consider when buying an action cam is what you'll use it for. With so many designs, price points, and features on offer, it's easy to find something that fits your desired usage and budget.

 The general ease of use should also influence your decision since some cameras (like the GoPro) offer more polished mobile apps and cloud storage services, while other brands can provide a more barebones but budget-friendly experience.

 All but one of the cameras featured below offer at least 4K video, with some exceeding this. Frame rate is another thing you'll want to consider, with many cameras offering 60 and 120 fps (frames per second) in 4K and higher resolutions. Shooting at a higher resolution provides smoother action and allows you to slow your footage down for smooth slow-motion video.

 Pricier cameras come with front-facing screens, which gives you [more options in terms of vlogging](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-terranomes-uncovering-treasure-in-virtual-landscapes/) and travel photography for framing your shot. If you're primarily looking for a camera mounted on a helmet, chest strap, mountain bike, or the outside of a vehicle, you might want to save money and weight by opting for something without a screen altogether. Don't worry—mobile apps often let you frame the camera and quickly review your settings.

 Cost is another big consideration. If you don't need the latest and greatest, you might be able to save a few hundred dollars by opting for last year's big thing. If you're going to be putting your camera somewhere risky, then you might want to spend even less than this on an off-brand camera that shoots decent footage, but that won't make you wince when you drop it off a cliff.

 If possible, use any cameras you're interested in, or at the very least, review the footage before you buy so you know what to expect. Remember that not all cameras are waterproof without underwater housing, but most of the more expensive models are.

| Pros                                                  | Cons                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5.3K video at 60fps, 4K at 120fps, and 2.7K at 240fps | More expensive than many rivals and off-brand alternatives |
| 33 feet waterproofing without an external housing     | Mounts, mods, spare batteries, and a microSD card required |
| Compatible with hundreds of mounts and accessories    |                                                            |

 The [HERO12 Black](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CDDY8F9L/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the latest from GoPro and one of the best action cameras you can get at the moment. It's a decent improvement over its predecessor and balances cost, image quality, and ease of use.

 You can capture HDR video and audio at up to 5.3K at 60fps and record 4x slow-motion action at 4K resolution or 8x slo-mo at 240 fps with 2.7K resolution. There’s also an [improvement in the megapixel](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) count, letting you capture high-quality 27MP images while shooting video, or get 24.7MP frame grabs from videos.

 Apart from the improved Emmy award-winning HyperSmooth 6.0 image stabilization feature on the GoPro Hero 12, its battery delivers twice more runtime than its predecessors, up to 70 minutes for continuous 5.3K recording at 60fps. Sturdy and tough, it is also waterproof down to 33ft, suitable for most water sports and underwater exploration. It also easily integrates with the [GoPro Quik app](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor).

 Other features we love about the GoPro Hero 12 include auto boost (for the widest possible HD shots), horizon lock (for steady footage even through 360-degree rotations), vertical and full-frame shots, and scheduled capture, to name a few. It also supports time-lapse videos and photos, wireless exports, and aftermarket bolt-ons like the [Max Lens Mod 2](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Max-Lens-HERO12-Black/dp/B0CFNFYMJD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for better performance.

| 4K video at 60 frames per second                               | Requires the use of waterproof housing to be weather-tight |
| Additional features like voice control and image stabilization | Software is a bit rough                                    |
| Includes housing and mounts in the box                         |                                                            |

 If you're looking for an affordable action camera, the [AKASO V50 Elite](https://www.amazon.com/AKASO-Control-Waterproof-Adjustable-Accessories/dp/B07J4TNYV8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is at the top of the list. Unlike cheaper cameras in this price range, the V50 Elite can record in 4K resolution at 60fps—usually, cameras in this range are limited to 30fps. This allows you to reduce footage by 50 percent for usable video for 24fps or 30fps projects.

 The camera has a 2-inch touch screen on the back, includes voice control, and can be submerged up to 130 feet with the included underwater case. It also features image stabilization, but its use is limited to 30fps in 4K and 2.7K resolution. Image quality is good for most applications, though the drop in quality will be noticeable compared to GoPro, DJI, and cameras at a high price point.

 The beauty of a budget action camera is that you take less of a financial hit if the unthinkable happens. That's not to say the AKASO isn't built tough, but if you drop it off a cliff, it'll cost much less to replace.

 Unfortunately, things aren't as smooth as the leading brands regarding the broader ecosystem, particularly software like mobile apps and cloud storage. AKASO hits the sweet spot for price and application and is also compatible with the now industry-standard GoPro mount.

 The [Insta360 ONE RS 1-inch 360](https://www.amazon.com/insta360-ONE-1-Inch-Co-Engineered-Stabilization/dp/B0B4DK8S1G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) camera is a dual-lens camera co-engineered with [Leica](https://leica-camera.com/en-US). Unlike rivals that use smaller sensors, Insta360 has created a 360-degree camera with a large 1-inch sensor. That's the same size sensor as many of the best modern [point-and-shoot cameras](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-vivo-v27-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 A larger sensor means the camera captures more information about the scene, improving overall image quality. It also means the sensor has more surface area to capture light, resulting in better low-light performance than smaller sensors.

 The camera features hallmark Insta360 features, including the company's excellent [FlowState](https://www.insta360.com/support/supportcourse?post%5Fid=13067) stabilization and the ability to lock the horizon for a steady and static shot even if you're being thrown around. You can capture up to 6K video or 21-megapixel 360-degree stills, either handheld or using [Insta360's "invisible" selfie stick](https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-114cm-Invisible-Selfie-Compatibility/dp/B0BKZNX4KF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 This camera isn't marketed as a rugged action camera, and as such, it's only rated for [IPX3 water resistance](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) against light rain or snow. If you're throwing the camera around, something like the [Insta360 X3](https://www.amazon.com/insta360-Waterproof-Single-Lens-Stabilization-Touchscreen/dp/B0B9H572LC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) might be better, but low-light performance and image quality suffer since the dual sensors are half the size. But if you want an action camera for its versatility rather than its durability, the ONE RS 1-inch 360 edition is hard to pass up.

Best 360 Action Camera

#####  Insta360 One RS

 The [DJI Osmo Action 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7X2LXQ6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is DJI's third shot at an action camera and one that tops out at 4K resolution. Despite this limitation, you can capture high-quality 4K HDR video in 10-bit color at up to 30 frames per second.

 Alternatively, you can capture up to 120 frames per second of standard definition video at up to 4K resolution. The DJI Osmo 3 also includes a timecode function that makes syncing footage from multiple cameras easier in post.

 DJI built the Osmo Action 3 to be tough. It can withstand a depth of 52 feet underwater or up to -4ºF without external housing. Slap [a case](https://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-Housing-Underwater-Protective-Accessories/dp/B0BLTTHBNF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) on it, and you can get to almost 200 feet underwater. Like other competing brands at this price point, the camera includes image stabilization (what DJI calls RockSteady 3.0) and horizon lock from any angle or rotation.

 The Osmo Action 3 is cheaper and smaller than GoPro's HERO range, and though there have traditionally been teething issues with DJI's firmware, the camera has come a long way since its launch. You'll also get features like timelapse, hyper-lapse, still image capture up to 12-megapixel, [RAW photos](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-xiaomi-redmi-note-12r-have-find-my-friends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), and vertical shooting mode. On top of this, different kits and accessories are available for adventurers, cyclists, skiers, and divers.

 It should come as no surprise that our pick for the best action camera overall, the [GoPro HERO12 Black](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CDDY8F9L/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), is also our pick for the best GoPro. This model of GoPro's latest series of action cameras balances features and price well, making it the best pick for most people.

 Whether you're looking to dive into action photography and videography or are a pro, the HERO12 Black will fit your needs well. You can snap 5.3K or 4K photos and video, is waterproof up to 33 feet, and GoPro's own [HyperSmooth](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/What-is-HyperSmooth?language=en%5FUS) technology to make sure your shots are crystal clear. The price might a bit shocking at $400, but for everything that the HERO12 Black offers, it's money well-spent.

 If you want more, there is also the [GoPro HERO12 Black Creator Edition](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CDFFVBBS/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202720&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871197%2Fbest-action-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This bundles the HERO12 Black with a number of useful accessories, including GoPro's Volka tripod, a Light Mod, and a Media Mod. You'll need to pay $550 for the add-ons, but if you're looking for the ultimate GoPro experience, it's worth it.

## FAQ

### What should I use action cameras for?

 You can use an action camera for recording video and taking still photos [in all sorts of situations and conditions](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-retrieve-lost-pictures-from-honor-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/). These cameras are designed to be small, rugged, and easy to mount. That makes them ideal for use outdoors and in circumstances where other cameras may be damaged by the elements. This includes underwater, attached to a bike or the outside of a vehicle, or even mounted on your dog. Their small size and relative ease of use (plus excellent compatibility with accessories) makes them ideal travel companions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### How do I connect an action camera to Wi-Fi?

 Most action cameras allow you to transfer footage wirelessly to a smartphone or computer and even control aspects of the camera over Wi-Fi. You can use the in-built menu to create a temporary Wi-Fi network and then connect to it using your smartphone or computer. Instructions will differ depending on your model of choice, your camera's smartphone app should guide you through the process.

### Are action cameras good for vlogging?

 Some action cameras are ideal for vlogging on account of their size, performance, and compatibility with [accessories like lights and microphones](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s3-review/). For vlogging, a forward-facing screen is going to help you frame your shot so be on the lookout for that. The GoPro HERO range is especially good for this since these cameras include a forward-facing screen, an optional Media Mod with an improved microphone, and even a LED light attachment.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Can action cameras take pictures?

 Yes, pretty much all action cameras include still photography modes. Some can shoot in RAW which gives you greater flexibility when editing your photos in post, while others can even capture full-size images (at sizes of 20 megapixels and above) while simultaneously shooting video. Despite this functionality, most cameras suffer compared to dedicated point-and-shoot, [mirrorless](https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/latest-graphics-framework-refresh-enhanced-laptops-featuring-intel-core-ultra-and-amd-ryzen-series/), or [digital SLRs](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-right-platform-for-content-creation-podcast-or-video/) on account of their small sensor size.

### Can I use an action camera as a webcam?

 Some action cameras can be used as a webcam since this functionality is built right in (including many GoPro models). Others can work as a webcam when [connected to a capture device using the camera's HDMI output](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-skyward-gazing-inside-the-world-of-x4-fpv-quads/). Just because you can, doesn't always mean you should however and the wide-angle lens used on most action cameras might not make for a flattering perspective on your next video call.
