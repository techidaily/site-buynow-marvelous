##  What to Look For in a Portable Charger in 2024

 The best portable chargers charge all of your essential devices. They come in all shapes and sizes, from small, 2,000 mAh ([milliamp hours](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-bypass-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-frp-by-drfone-android/)) charging sticks to high-capacity power banks packing more than 30,000 mAh of pure electricity.

 Choosing the correct portable charger comes down to three key criteria: capacity, size, and charging time.

 Portable chargers run capacity anywhere from 2,000 mAh to 30,000 mAh. Small 5,000 mAh chargers are typically suitable for two full smartphone charges, whereas a 20,000 mAh portable charger can charge devices with larger batteries, like laptops, several times over.

 In addition, portable chargers come in different sizes and weights. Pocket-sized portable chargers are easy to carry but generally have a single USB port. Larger capacity portable batteries weigh more but charge faster and hold additional USB ports to charge two or more devices simultaneously.

 Lastly, charging time is important. Fast chargers can charge a smartphone from zero to full within 40 minutes, whereas pocket-sized and solar power chargers may take more time. You need to weigh charging time against the charger size in order to find the right product for you.

 Consider the devices you plan on charging, your device's capacity, the number of devices to charge, and how frequently you have to access a wall charger. A portable charger that doesn't fit your needs will likely just sit at home unused, so definitely think about what you need.

 Now, keep reading to learn more about our picks for the best portable chargers.

| â Sleek, minimalist design                                   | â Limited capacity (18w output) |
| â PowerIQ and VoltageBoost optimizes charging speeds         |                                 |

 The [Anker PowerCore Slim 10000 Portable Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207834&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770220%2Fbest-portable-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) takes our top award for the best overall portable charger. Its efficiency is on point, with 10,000 mAh good to charge an iPhone 12 two times.

 Recharging time from zero to full is modest, taking roughly 6 hours. It also rocks with an ultra-slim profile and fits comfortably in a front or back pocket. With a light, textured surface that mimics plaid, this portable charger also just plain looks good.

 The PowerCore Slim also boasts a proprietary technology called [PowerIQ](https://www.anker.com/deals/poweriq), which identifies all connected devices and automatically adjusts voltage output to maximize charging speed.

 A separate proprietary feature, VoltageBoost, also helps smoothen erratic voltage output due to cable resistance. Expect it to recognize your device and offer uninterrupted charging speeds this way.

 Although not the [most rugged option](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-contacts-files-from-infinix-smart-7-hd-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/) out there, the Anker PowerCore Slim 10000 carries all essential safety systems (e.,g. overcharge and short circuit protection), in addition to fireproof casing and temperature controls.

 Our only downside with the Anker PowerCore Slim 10000 is that it can only charge a single device at a time. However, its exceptional build quality, fast/consistent charging, and valuer price point are well worth it.

| â Can power an iPhone 13 up to 3 times | â No integrated cables                 |

 The [Iniu Portable Charger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZDXDG8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207834&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770220%2Fbest-portable-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent, cheap option for users with only one device to charge regularly. Using triple 3A outputs, it can charge up to three devices at the same time. From zero to full charge, its 10,000 mAh capacity is enough to power an iPad Air once and an iPhone 13 up to 3 times.

 Plus, unlike the Anker PowerCore Slim 10000, the Iniu Portable Charger comes with a power indicator. Curiously shaped like a pawprint, it lets you know how much remaining juice there is.

 We also love the fact the Iniu Portable Charger is super slim. At only 0.5 inches thick, it is pocket and purse-friendly. For the price point, this portable charger offers a nice combination of capacity, size, and triple 3A outputs for multi-device charging.

It is an absolute monster of a portable charger, with a 20,000 mAh battery capacity, a USB-C port, a wireless Qi charger, and two USB-A ports.

 It also comes with pass-through charging, converting it into a universal power adapter that charges itself while charging other devices.

 One of our favorite features of the Omni 20 Portable Charger is its design and construction. A sharp LCD shows remaining power, and a soft touch rubber construction helps absorb shock and provides grip in tight quarters.

 The Omni 20 isn't the cheapest portable charger around, but it's worth the price of admission.

 The [BigBlue 14W SunPower](https://www.amazon.com/BigBlue-Foldable-Waterproof-SunPower-Cellphones/dp/B09B95QZXK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207834&th=1&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770220%2Fbest-portable-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a compact and lightweight solar chargerâ5.8 x 6.02 x 2.12 inches when folded and weighing only 0.8 lbsâthat won't occupy much space inside your backpack. Once unfolded, you can expand it over your bag while walking or lay it on the ground. As long as thereâs enough sunlight, the BigBlue 14W SunPower can deliver up to 14W of power to your phone or other gadgets, as hinted in its name. 

 The charger comes with a detachable USB-A to USB-C charging cable, meaning you can hook up a different charging cable (such as a Lightning cable) with the only requirement being the cable having a USB-A port on one end to connect it to the charger. 

 Aside from the charging cable, you're also getting two carabiners for hooking the BigBlue SunPower to your backpack while on the move, or even attaching it to a tent and letting it charge your devices while you take a rest. The good news is that thanks to IPX-4 [water resistance](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), you can use the charger even when it's raining. 

 While it does a lot, the BigBlue SunPower doesnât feature an auto resume option. In other words, if thereâs a sudden drop in sunlight severe enough to thwart the charging process âfor example, if you enter a tunnelâ youâll need to reconnect the charging device to continue the top-up process.

 If you need a portable charger that's rugged enough to take wherever you go, [Techsmarter's Rugged & Waterproof Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/Techsmarter-Waterproof-Shockproof-Dustproof-Flashlight/dp/B07P92ZR72?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207834&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F770220%2Fbest-portable-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great choice. It offers a large 20,000mAh cell that's suitable for at least five full charges of most modern Android phones (and more for iPhone users), and it comes with three outputs, including an 18W USB-C [Power Delivery](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/) port.

 What makes this charger special is its design, which is built to withstand up to three-foot drops without getting damaged. It comes with [IP66 certification](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) which helps to protect it against water and dirt, and its rubberized construction makes it robust enough to toss in a backpack while on the go. It even comes with a built-in LED flashlight with High Torch, Low, Strobe, and SOS settings.

 Other chargers offer faster speed, and there's no fancy solar-powered recharge feature or wireless charging, but this power pack will certainly get the job done for anyone who needs extra power on the go.

And, thanks to its 12W power output, it can do so in just a couple of hours. The small size and low weight make it perfect for use when traveling or just as some emergency power to carry around in your daily life.

 The 5200mAh power bank has both a USB-C and USB-A port for charging---allowing you to charge two devices simultaneously. Trickle charge mode is a button away if you need to power smaller devices like [Bluetooth headphones](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/perfezionamento-dei-numeri-italiani-per-la-comunicazione-da-1-1000/) without overcharging. The power bank itself can be recharged in a couple of hours.

 Overall, the Anker 321 is smaller than most lipstick-style portable chargers, and the flatter design makes it easier to carry in your pocket. As long as you aren't expecting to be able to charge your [iPhone 14](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/complete-review-for-hero4-black/) multiple times, or fast charge your [Samsung Galaxy S22](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-elite-8-augmenting-tools-for-professional-broadcasts/), it's a great battery backup.
