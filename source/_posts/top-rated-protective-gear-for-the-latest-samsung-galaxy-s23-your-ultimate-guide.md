##  What to Look For in a Galaxy S23 Case in 2024

 If you're upgrading from the Samsung Galaxy S22 to the S23, unfortunately you can't use your old case. While the two phones look similar, [they have enough differences that you'll need a new case](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-vivo-x100-pro-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-android/).

 The first thing you'll want to consider when looking for a case to protect your Galaxy S23 is what kind of form factor you need. How are you using your phone? Are you looking for a case with a built-in stand for watching videos? Do you want a case that doubles as a wallet?

 You'll also want to consider just how much protection you require. If your phone mostly stays in your pocket until you're home or at the office, you probably won't need the same rugged phone case someone who works outdoors would need.

 The form factor and amount of protection you need will largely dictate the material the case is made from, but not always. For example, if you're looking for a classy look, you might want a leather case. On the other hand, you may want a case with a matte finish for better grip.

 While some cases feature support for wireless charging, not all of them do. For the most part, if a case supports [wireless charging](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), the manufacturer will mention that. If a case doesn't explicitly mention that it supports wireless charging, don't expect it to.

 Finally, there's the finish. The form factor decides how much of the phone you'll see under the case, but if you want to see your phone, you can opt for a clear case. Other cases come in different colors, letting you choose the one that speaks most to you.

 The cases below will only fit the standard Samsung Galaxy S23 model. They will not fit on the S23 Plus or Ultra. Have a different model?

| Pros                                        | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ✓ Slim fit doesn't add bulk                 | ✗ Limited color options |
| ✓ Anti-slip finish helps you keep your grip |                         |
| ✓ Good drop protection                      |                         |

 If you're looking for solid protection for your phone and a slim fit that doesn't add much bulk, the [Spigen Liquid Air Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Galaxy-Case/dp/B0BJRJX8Z4?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option.

 The design of the case looks nice, but it's also functional. Those triangle shapes give the surface of the case an anti-slip finish---which means your phone is less likely to sail across the concrete the next time you fish it out of your pocket.

 Raised bezels on the front and rear protect both your screen and the glass on the camera lenses from damage. The case is made out of a flexible material, which means that the squared-off edges still offer plenty of protection from drops. That flexibility also makes fitting your phone into the case much easier than cases with rigid frames.

 The Spigen Liquid Air Designed for Galaxy S23 Case is available in [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Galaxy-Case/dp/B0BJRJX8Z4?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Abyss Green](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Galaxy-Case/dp/B0BJSH42V5?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) finishes.

 Choosing a budget case for your phone can be tricky because the cheaper you get, the less likely you can tell if a case brand is quality. That's no problem with the [Caseology Parallax](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Designed-Samsung-Military/dp/B0BHFC3PLD?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), since the company has been around for years and has a great reputation.

 The Parallax comes with a unique-looking pattern on the back. The company calls this a 3D Hexa Cube Design, which lets you easily hold onto the phone. A textured [Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) grip on the edges helps you keep from dropping your phone, as well.

 Caseology doesn't mention any specific drop test numbers but does say that the case is "certified with [military-grade protection](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/)" on its Amazon page. It also features support for wireless charging, which is always nice to know.

| Pros                                         | Cons               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| ✓ Slots for up to nine cards                 | ✗ Not real leather |
| ✓ Zippered money pocket keeps your cash safe |                    |
| ✓ Comes in several colors                    |                    |

 If you're carrying your phone around already, do you really need to carry a wallet as well? Not if you've got a wallet case like the [XcaseBar Wallet Case](https://www.amazon.com/XcaseBar-Samsung-Blocking%E3%80%91-Leather-Shockproof/dp/B0BNWRMY9G?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Looking at the wallet features, the XcaseBar features a pocket to hold cash, plus nine card slots, which is more than you'll find in many wallet cases. The case also has [RFID](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/is-optimal-hdr-with-aurora-worth-it/) shielding, meaning you can feel safer about your card information.

 Another aspect of the case that you don't often see in other cases is the zipper on the money compartment. If you never feel safe carrying money in other wallet-style cases, you should feel better here, since the zipper guarantees that you can keep your cash safe.

 While the case has a leather look, it isn't real leather. This isn't automatically negative or positive; instead, it depends on what you're looking for (and there is a [leather wallet case](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-amp-up-illumination-basic-steps-to-lighten-iphone-films/) if faux leather is a dealbreaker). On the other hand, it does mean it's available in seven different color varieties, including [Blue Green](https://www.amazon.com/XcaseBar-Samsung-Blocking%E3%80%91-Leather-Shockproof/dp/B0BNWRSNPK?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Light Coffee](https://www.amazon.com/XcaseBar-Samsung-Blocking%E3%80%91-Leather-Shockproof/dp/B0BNWPWP37?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Wine Red](https://www.amazon.com/XcaseBar-Samsung-Blocking%E3%80%91-Leather-Shockproof/dp/B0BNWQ3P3C?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and more.

| Pros                              | Cons    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| ✓ Drop tested from 20 feet        | ✗ Bulky |
| ✓ Supports most wireless chargers |         |
| ✓ Plenty of finish options        |         |

 Most people only need minor protection for their phones. If you're taking your phone into heavy-duty areas or just rough on phones, you need a rugged case like the [UAG's Monarch Case](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Designed-Samsung/dp/B0BSF8RJJN?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 You can tell simply by looking at this case that it's built like a tank. It has five layers of protection, including UAG's armor frame, a shock-resistant core, and a layer of carbon fiber or leather, depending on which finish you choose. The case is military-grade drop tested from 20 feet, as well.

 Despite the relatively bulky size of the case, you don't have to worry about it getting in the way of wireless charging. While it isn't universally compatible, Urban Armor Gear says that the case is compatible with most third-party [wireless chargers](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Raised bezels offer extra screen and camera protection | ✗ Transparent look isn't for everyone |
| ✓ Material won't yellow over time                        |                                       |

 If you want to admire your phone's design while keeping it protected, a clear case is your best bet. The [okzilla 360 All-Round Clear Case](https://www.amazon.com/okzilla-Yellowing-Protection-Transparent-Protective/dp/B0BQ338RYH?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) combines a clear finish with some great features, making it a perfect choice.

 The 360 All-Round Clear Case uses a combination of soft TPU and a harder transparent frame to give your phone more protection. Raised bezels protect the screen and the camera lens from potential damage when you set the phone down.

 Transparent cases tend to have two major issues: they attract fingerprints, and they can [turn yellow over time](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/conquering-instagrams-video-challenges-head-on/). This case addresses both concerns, with a fingerprint-resistant design and material that okzilla says won't turn yellowish.

 In addition to being transparent, the case is also quite slim, meaning you won't notice extra bulk with okzilla's case.

| ✓ Slim fit means a better fit in your pocket | ✗ No color options |
| ✓ Matte coating helps your grip              |                    |
| ✓ Scratch-resistant                          |                    |

 If you don't want to opt for a completely transparent case, a thin case still lets you enjoy the shape and feel of your phone. The [Spigen Thin Fit](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Thin-Designed-Galaxy-Case/dp/B0BJSTF2JZ?tag=htg-v2-8cqu16f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202709&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871442%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a perfect combination of slim fit, lightweight build, and plenty of protection.

 This case uses a hybrid polycarbonate and TPU material to add drop protection to the S23 without bulk. The case also uses the same Air Cushion Technology that Spigen uses in the Liquid Air case we also recommend as the [best case overall](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-do-you-get-sun-stone-evolutions-in-pokemon-for-oppo-reno-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 Instead of leaving holes for the buttons, Spigen added tactile buttons to the Thin Fit. These provide a much better feel when adjusting the volume and using other buttons than many alternative cases on the market. It can take some getting used to, but it doesn't take long.

 The plastic composite is scratch-resistant, so the case should keep its good looks for quite some time to boot.
