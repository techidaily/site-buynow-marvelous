 For just a few bucks more per month than what you would pay for a basic PlayStation Plus subscription, you can upgrade to PlayStation Plus Extra and gain access to a catalog of games. There are hundreds of games in the Catalog, but these 10 alone more than justify the added cost.

## 1 _Death Stranding Director's Cut_

Kojima Productions/PlayStation

 The director's cut of Kojima Productions's inaugural title brought new gameplay features and enhanced graphical options to capitalize on the [PS5's performance capabilities](https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-engaging-book-video-summaries/). _Death Stranding_ is a masterpiece worth experiencing, but it is also a unique trip that does not suit everyone's tastes. Subscribing to PlayStation Plus Extra will let you test the waters without investing in the full-priced purchase.

## 2 _Monster Hunter Rise_ 

![The title screen for Monster Hunter Rise.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/the-title-screen-for-monster-hunter-rise.png) 

Capcom

 Dedicated fans of the _Monster Hunter_ franchise can effortlessly devote hundreds upon hundreds of hours of playtime to each entry in the series. _Monster Hunter Rise_ is no exception, especially when you factor in the PlayStation version's improved graphics and [frame rate](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-infinix-smart-7-hd-devices-by-drfone-android/) over the original Nintendo Switch release. If you've never tried _Monster Hunter_ before Sony's subscription lets you dip your toes for a reasonable fee.

## 3 _Red Dead Redemption 2_ 

![The title screen for Red Dead Redemption 2.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/the-title-screen-for-red-dead-redemption-2.png) 

Take2/Rockstar

 There are some games that push hardware to the point that they can [turn a computer into a space heater](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-a-step-by-step-strategy-for-dominating-the-digital-marketing-arena/). _Red Dead Redemption 2_ is one of those games, due largely to the size of its open world and the level of graphical fidelity it delivers. Add to that a high level of narrative quality and immersion, and it almost feels like a steal that you can play it at a fraction of its MSRP with a PlayStation Plus Extra subscription.

## 4 _Disco Elysium - The Final Cut_ 

![The title screen for Disco Elysium - The Final Cut.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/the-title-screen-for-disco-elysium-the-final-cut.png) 

ZA/UM

 The PlayStation Plus Game Catalog is also a place where you can discover a number of great indie titles that might otherwise fly under your radar. _Disco Elysium_, for example, is beloved for its unique take on the CRPG genre and in-depth dialogue system. If _Disco Elysium_ helps you discover [a love for indie games](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-itel-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), consider using your PS+ subscription to try other indie hits like _Hollow Knight_ or _Spiritfarer_.

## 5 _Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag_ 

![A promotional image for Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/a-promotional-image-for-assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag.png) 

Ubisoft

 There are about a dozen _Assassin's Creed_ titles in the PlayStation Plus Extra Game Catalog, which in itself is a great selling point, but the fact that _Black Flag_is one of them makes it worthy of a special mention. Originally released in 2013, _Assassin's Creed IV:_ _Black Flag_ remains one of the most beloved and highly-rated entries in the series.

## 6 _Horizon Forbidden West_ 

![A promotional image for Horizon Forbidden West.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/a-promotional-image-for-horizon-forbidden-west.png) 

PlayStation

 The _Horizon_ franchise is one of Sony's flagship titles, and has become a valid reason to buy a PS4 or PS5 in the first place. The fact that you can experience Aloy's adventure for such a low price of entry is almost too good to be true. This is an especially appealing deal for new PlayStation owners who are eager to see what the platform can offer.

## 7 _13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim_ 

![The title screen for 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/the-title-screen-for-13-sentinels-aegis-rim.png) 

Atlus

_13 Sentinels_ is a gripping, narrative-driven game that tells a complex story through the various perspectives of a diverse cast of memorable characters. It's full of classic movie references, tactical mecha-inspired battles, and unique storytelling moments. With a playtime of roughly 30 to 40 hours, it's a great length for leisurely completion in a one-month subscription period.

CD Projekt RED

_The Witcher 3_ proved to be an impeccable blend of open-world storytelling, intense action combat, and compelling character work when it was released in 2015\. It remains a near-perfect gaming experience to this day, especially with visual and mechanical improvements implemented with the PS5 release of the game.

## 9 _Judgment_

SEGA

_Judgment_ is a hidden gem of the PS+ Extra Game Catalog that will put you in the shoes of a lawyer-turned-private detective navigating Tokyo's criminal underworld. Judgment comes from the same studio as the _Yakuza_ and _Like a Dragon_ series and features similar gameplay and aesthetics but with a crime-solving twist. It's the perfect combination of brawler and detective game.

FromSoftware

 If you enjoyed _Elden Ring_ or any of the _Dark Souls_ games, you owe it to yourself to play _Bloodborne_ if you have not yet done so. Even in a post-_Elden Ring_ world, _Bloodborne_ remains a favorite of many die-hard FromSoftware fans. Considering it's a PlayStation-exclusive title, the fact that _Bloodborne_ is available in the Game Catalog means that subscribing to PlayStation Plus Extra is perhaps the most economical way to enjoy this one-of-a-kind experience.

---

 Subscribing to PlayStation Plus Extra costs just a fraction of what you would pay buying a new game at full price. In exchange, you get unlimited access to hundreds of great games, including some of the [best story-driven experiences](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/journey-to-blockchain-stardom-discover-the-top-7-generator-tools-for-2024/), for an entire month. New titles join the Game Catalog every month, so it's also worth checking back in occasionally to see if re-upping your sub is worth it for you.
