##  What to Look for With a Waterproof Camera in 2024

 Most cameras aren't completely waterproof, and while many can handle some rain during outdoor shoots, the options are limited for cameras that you can take on underwater shoots. Of course, not all waterproof cameras are created equal, either. While some are ideal for shooting marine life documentaries, others are designed for the frantic action of water sports.

 Levels of waterproofing differ as well. Depending on their [water resistance rating](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/), some cameras can work in wet conditions, while others can be taken for long underwater shoots and down to impressive depths. If you're looking for an underwater camera, consider the duration and depth of the dive. You'll want to invest in underwater cameras that can last for the entirety of a dive, exploration, or shoot. Battery life is an important consideration here, too—water resistance won't matter so much if your camera battery dies mid-shoot.

 On the other hand, while action cameras for recording water-based sports require high levels of water resistance, their photo and video capture speeds and quality are more essential factors. Also, if you plan to dive deep and capture video, you'll need a hi-res waterproof camera with sufficient storage for sharp images and improved low-light performance for clear visibility. You may also want a waterproof camera that supports wide-angle and macrophotography to capture different perspectives. Additionally, ensure that the camera is leak-proof, shockproof, and freezeproof.

 Of course, most shopping decisions come down to the price. Waterproof cameras can be pricey, but we've included a selection across the price spectrum to meet every budget.

Olympus

| Pros                                            | Cons                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Waterproof down to a depth of 50ft              | Lacks full manual controls |
| CMOS sensor plus four macro shooting modes      | No eye-level viewfinder    |
| Supports 4K video and lossless RAW photos       |                            |
| Four macro modes, wide-angle, and Wi-Fi support |                            |

 The [Olympus Tough TG-6 Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Tough-TG-6-Waterproof-Camera/dp/B07RC8HPHL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent camera to get for its durability and portability. An improvement on the already impressive Olympus Tough TG-5, it starts up in less than 2 seconds, comes with a user-friendly interface, and has an all-around solid build.

 This Olympus camera features a 12MP lens, an F2.0 aperture, and a back-illuminated CMOS sensor with an anti-reflective coating for improved lighting. While it shoots decent pictures during the day comparable to smartphones, it excels at low-light cinematography, even at 50ft underwater.

 It comes with a 3-inch LCD screen with 1.04 million dots for improved display resolution and can reach up to 8x zoom with manual focus support. The TG-6 is also great for taking close-up 1 cm macrophotography shots. The camera has four macro shooting modes, allowing you to capture smaller objects in much greater detail than most of the competition, up to 44x zoom.

 Of course, the Tough TG-6 has plenty of features for underwater photos. Olympius has packed in five underwater shooting modes and three white balance modes. It can record 4K video and 120fps high-speed movies for water sports, so the action won't be blurry.

 Finally, the TG-6 supports RAW photos and has a battery life of about two hours, so you'll be able to get all the footage you need in the format you need it in.

_AKASO_

| Pros                                                     | Cons                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 20MP camera with remote control, waterproof down to 98ft | Doesn’t support RAW format     |
| Burst photos, time-lapse photos, and 4K support          | Relatively cheap build quality |
| Built-in Wi-Fi with external mic support                 |                                |
| Supports wide-angle capture                              |                                |

 While most waterproof cameras cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, beginners and hobbyists can rely on budget-friendly options such as the [AKASO EK7000 Camera](https://www.amazon.com/AKASO-EK7000-Sports-Waterproof-Camcorder/dp/B01HGM33HG/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Priced at under $100, this action camera can give costlier waterproof cameras a run for their money. It is ultra-compact and has a user-friendly interface, making it great for beginners—though you will have to deal with a cheap-feeling build quality. This isn't a deal-breaker, however, especially for the price point.

 Whereas the [Olympus Tough TG-6](https://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Tough-TG-6-Waterproof-Camera/dp/B07RC8HPHL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) sports a 12MP camera, the ultra-compact AKASO EK700 has a 20MP camera equipped with a CMOS image sensor. For the price, it captures decent images that you can enhance via Photoshop or other photo editing software. Waterproof down to a depth of 98ft, the EK7000 also comes with a durable waterproof case.

 The AKASO EK7000 features a small 2-inch LCD screen with a 1x optical zoom capability. You can record 4K videos at 25fps, slow 720p motion videos at 120fps, and 1080p videos at 60fps. For most underwater footage enthusiasts, this camera has all the features you need to shoot exactly what you want.

 AKASO's camera also supports wide-angle photography, allowing you to capture more of the scene in the frame. It comes with a splash-resistant (but _not_ waterproof) wireless wrist remote and can also be controlled on your phone directly via Wi-Fi for up to 10m.

 Lastly, the EK7000 supports HDMI connectivity and is compatible with standard [GoPro accessories](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/A12EB99C-36E1-455F-82B4-8741B6EDEFFA?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), making this budget waterproof camera even easier to use.

Divers favor this compact, easy-to-use, shockproof camera, which is waterproof down to a depth of 200ft. It will excel at depths where the [Olympus Tough TG-6](https://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Tough-TG-6-Waterproof-Camera/dp/B07RC8HPHL/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and the [AKASO EK7000](https://www.amazon.com/AKASO-EK7000-Sports-Waterproof-Camcorder/dp/B01HGM33HG/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will fail.

 The Micro 3.0's 16MP camera has a [CMOS image sensor](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/innovative-techniques-for-unique-canon-timelapse-vids/) and can capture images in single or continuous mode, up to 10 per second. It can take time-lapse photos and capture 8MP still images even while recording video, ensuring you never miss an important scene. Speaking of, you can also record 4K videos at 30fps, 1080p video at 120fps, and snap RAW photos. There is even an upside-down shooting mode.

 This waterproof camera supports five Land and Sea scene modes, three color correction filters, and manual light balance for low-light scenarios.

 Not much has changed regarding the [GoPro Hero 12 Black](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CDDY8F9L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)’s design—the camera looks similar to previous iterations and has the same featherlight weight and compact dimensions as the [Hero 11](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO11-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CDFGM6G3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The lens has an f/2.5 aperture with a 151-degree field of view. However, it is removable, and by replacing it with the [Max Lens Mod 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Max-Lens-HERO12-Black/dp/B0CFNFYMJD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you can boost the Hero 12’s scope to a highly impressive 177 degrees. 

 The Hero 12 has a front screen and a bright, 2.27-inch, touch-sensitive rear screen. You have the option of Easy Mode or Pro Mode when navigating the menu system. The former simplifies the whole process if you’re a GoPro newbie, and the latter is what you will switch to once you can handle more control. 

 Image quality still easily beats the competition. Video resolution remains at 5.3K, while stills are 27MP. You can record video in an 8:7 aspect ratio, which simplifies the editing process, and choose from frame rates of up to 240FPS for sublime slow-motion filming. 

 High frame rates are even available when GoPro’s practical Horizon Leveling feature is active. It corrects tilting when filming activities such as biking or skiing. But you also get a stabilization update to HyperSmooth 6.0 with support for horizon locking should you need it. 

 The GoPro Hero 12 Black includes a 1,720mAh Enduro battery. This battery was once a luxury accessory, but it is now part of the package and delivers better battery life and superior performance in extreme temperatures. You can try out the multipurpose [GoPro Volta](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Volta-Official-Accessory/dp/B09XY38VG2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) battery grip or purchase extra [Enduro batteries](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Battery-Charger-Enduro-Batteries/dp/B0B4DKKKF6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for longer life. 

 Regarding its waterproof depth rating, you can take this camera down to 33 feet without additional housing. It’s ideal for surface-based aquatic activities, such as snorkeling or kayaking. However, if you’re a scuba diver, you can purchase [waterproof housing](https://www.amazon.com/Protective-Housing-HERO9-Black-Accessory/dp/B08FRTLX2M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-waterproof-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that lets you take it as low as 196 feet.

## FAQ

### Are waterproof cameras worth it?

 If underwater exploration or action sports excite you, then yes, waterproof cameras are worth it. If however, you're only a dabbler, you can skip expensive ones for budget options like the AKASO 7000\.

### What's the difference between a waterproof and water-resistant camera?

 A waterproof camera such as the SeaLife Micro 3.0 is built to endure moisture and water pressure at depths of up to 200ft. Conversely, a water-resistant camera is only splash resistant. While these terms are often mistaken for each other, they mean different things.

### What are water resistance ratings?

[Water resistance ratings](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) indicate whether a device or gadget is either water-resistant or waterproof. Water-resistant devices can endure some splashing, while waterproof devices are suitable for swimming to specific depths and for a specific duration.
