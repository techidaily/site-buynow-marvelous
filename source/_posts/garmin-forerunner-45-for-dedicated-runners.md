 Pros

* Excellent ergonomic design
* Awesome battery life
* Wrist rest is second to none

 Cons

* No backlighting
* A bit pricey

 The MX Ergo K860 is a front-runner for wireless workplace keyboards, featuring much of the tech used in Logitech's vaunted wireless MX Keys keyboard. The split layout of this particular keyboard can present a slight learning curve for users who need to be fluent touch typists, but it is easily one of the most comfortable and sleek keyboards available.

 The keyboard has Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity for either Windows or macOS and can reportedly operate for up to two years on a single pair of AAA batteries. The long battery life is undoubtedly a plus, but the lack of backlighting is a bit of a drag.

 The K860 features an integrated wristrest that is among the most comfortable. While it does provide excellent support and is something of a necessity with ergonomic keyboards, the inability to separate the wrist rest from the keyboard itself could present a problem if it ever wears out, forcing you to buy a new unit altogether.

 Pros

* Long battery life
* Budget friendly
* Low learning curve

 Cons

* Occasional input lag

 The Logitech K350 is a good choice for anyone looking for a basic wireless keyboard with an ergonomic design. This keyboard is a single-piece unit, so you won't have to spend much time re-learning how to type. Each key features a wave design that flows perfectly to the next, making long-term typing much more comfortable.

 The keyboard also features a padded wrist rest and adjustable legs for comfort. The universal wireless receiver lets you connect mice and even other keyboards without using other USB dongles; great for computers where USB ports are at a premium.

 The Logitech K350 uses two AAA batteries for power and can reportedly run for up to three years before swapping them out. The keyboard features dedicated media keys for streaming music and movies and fully customizable F keys to help streamline your workflow.

 Pros

* Extensive compatibility
* Awesome battery life
* Dedicated text edit macro keys

 Cons

* Membrane keys
* Split layout isn't for everyone

 Apple computer users should look at the Kinesis Freestyle2 blue wireless ergonomic keyboard with a bevy of Apple-specific keyboard shortcuts, including cut, copy, paste, and undo. Connecting to your Apple machine via Bluetooth 3.0, a single battery charge on the Kinesis should last around 300 hours or six months (based on two hours per day of typing).

 Youâ€™ll immediately discover that the negative slope design reduces the required extension of your wrist to hit each key. Available with three different channels, the Bluetooth-based functionality allows for three devices to be synced at one time (switching between the devices requires the single press of a key). Additional buttons include a shortcut for hiding (and showing) the dock and advanced multimedia playback and volume controls.

 Pros

* Fully customizable
* Tenting stands available
* Windows/Mac/Linux compatible

 Cons

* Reports of issues with SmartSet app
* May be uncomfortable for those with larger hands

 Whether you're a professional or hobbyist, gaming can take a toll on your wrists and hands. The Kinesis Freestyle Edge keyboard is here to keep you comfortable during all but the most intense gaming sessions. This keyboard has two separate pieces that can be placed in various configurations to feel more natural. The left section of the keyboard can be used on its own as a gamepad to make room for a larger mouse, microphone, or other equipment you may need. Both halves of the keyboard can be placed up to 20 inches apart for more comfortable typing and to make room for additional peripherals.

 The keyboard features Cherry MX Blue switches for a clicky, tactile response and durability. Each of the 95 keys can be custom backlit with over 16.8 million color combinations and ten different effects. They can also be remapped on the fly with the SmartSet app, and up to nine other user profiles can be stored in the keyboard's onboard 4MB memory. This keyboard features plug-and-play functionality for Windows, Mac, and Linux-based systems, so you don't have to worry about downloading extra drivers or software.

## What to Look For in an Ergonomic Keyboard

### **Usage**

 Where will you be using this keyboard? Is it mainly for personal use, or will you take it to the office? Do you need an ergonomic keyboard explicitly made with gamers in mind? While you can use a keyboard for multiple purposes, you may enjoy customizing which one you buy based on how you will use it the most.

### **Mac vs. PC**

 Do you have a Mac or a PC? While it seems like keyboards should be usable with both, thatâ€™s not always the case. You need to make sure whatever keyboard you buy is compatible with your system (this is usually a bigger problem for Macs rather than PCs). Additionally, the two operating systems have slightly different keys. While you can often use mapping software to alleviate these issues, you may want to purchase a keyboard specifically designed for your type of machine.

### **Keyboard size**

 Do you need a full-size keyboard, complete with a number pad? If youâ€™re inputting numbers, you probably find the number pad vital. But if youâ€™re used to typing on a laptop, itâ€™s likely you barely use it. Do you need a foldable, portable keyboard? Or do you need something with a small footprint but not necessarily mobile? You can find ergonomic keyboards in all sizesâ€”think about what youâ€™ll need.

 FAQ

* Do ergonomic keyboards really help?  
 While there's not enough evidence available to establish that ergonomic keyboards can prevent RSI, carpal tunnel, or other ailments, they have been shown to reduce strain on the body by allowing for more natural angles and positioning while typing. That said, if you experience symptoms like numbness or nerve pain, you should immediately consult your doctor.
* How does an ergonomic keyboard differ from a regular keyboard?  
 Ergonomic keyboards separate the standard keyboard layout into two halves. Splitting the keys in half roughly around the center of the keyboard allows the designer to tilt each half in a way that encourages a more natural hand and wrist position when addressing the keys, and reduces joint and muscle strain while typing.
* How can you adjust to using an ergonomic keyboard?  
 If possible, start by using an ergonomic keyboard in much the same way you would a standard keyboard, to give your hands (and brain) time to adapt to the slight differences in key layout. Then, when you're generally familiar with the new deck, start adjusting the keyboard to best suit your hands and typing style; many ergonomic keyboards will allow you to adjust not only the horizontal tilt of the separate halves but also the vertical lift. Find the angle and height that are most comfortable for your hands and seated position.
