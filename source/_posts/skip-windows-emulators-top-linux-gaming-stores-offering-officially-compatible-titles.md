## Skip Windows Emulators: Top Linux Gaming Stores Offering Officially Compatible Titles

As a Linux user, finding games that run natively on your desktop can be challenging. Many popular games are developed primarily for Windows, leaving Linux users to rely on emulators or compatibility layers like Wine.

 Yet, several game stores offer native Linux games, making it easier than ever to enjoy your favorite titles without the hassle of emulation.

##  Why You Should Use Native Linux Games Stores

 Gaming on Linux has come a long way in recent years, with more and more game developers releasing native Linux versions of their games. Native Linux games are designed specifically for Linux, meaning they'll run smoothly and without any compatibility issues. They provide a more straightforward installation process with no complex setup to worry about.

 The process of finding and installing native Linux games varies depending on the platform you're using. Most major game stores, such as Steam and GOG, have dedicated Linux sections or filters to help you discover compatible titles. Moreover, platforms like Flathub and Snap Store provide user-friendly ways to install their games.

 What if your favorite game isn't available natively on Linux? Don't despair! While the selection of native Linux games is constantly growing, there might still be some titles unavailable. If that is the case, consider checking Windows emulation software like [Proton](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-professional-level-youtube-content-via-adobe-premiere/) or [Wine](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-list-best-no-cost-lut-downloads/). But keep an eye out for future releases, as more and more games are being made available for Linux, so the game you love could be supported natively soon.

##  Steam

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) is the front-runner in Linux gaming. With its dedicated Linux section, it's no surprise that Linux users flock to Steam for their gaming needs. Valve, the company behind Steam, supports Linux and has even made a Linux-based operating system called SteamOS.

 Steam also has a built-in client that makes it easy to download and install games, as well as organize your game library. It also offers a wide range of indie games, as well as games from smaller developers.

 To find native Linux games on Steam, navigate to the "Categories" tab and select "SteamOS + Linux" to view all games native to Linux on Steam. You can also look up a specific game title and check its compatible platforms. If there's a small Steam icon alongside the Windows icon, it indicates compatibility with SteamOS and Linux.

[GOG](https://www.gog.com/en) is the go-to game store for Linux users. With a focus on preserving gaming classics and supporting indie developers, GOG provides Linux users with a unique catalog of games that prioritize compatibility and user freedom. From retro RPGs to modern masterpieces, GOG's commitment to Linux gaming is evident in its growing collection of native titles.

 It also has a large selection of DRM-free games, which means that you can download and play them without any limitations. This is a significant advantage for Linux users, as some game publishers are not ready to provide Linux support.

 Finding native Linux games on GOG is simple. Firstly, go to the "Store" tab and select "Browse All Games". Then, access the Operating Systems drop-down menu and select "Linux" to apply the appropriate filter. You can further look for the Linux icon on each game's thumbnail to ensure it's a native Linux game.

##  ArchWiki's List of Games Page

![Arch Linux logo on the ArchWiki website.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/archlinux.jpg) 

Jordan Gloor / How-To Geek

 The ArchWiki is a great resource for Linux gamers who are looking for hard-to-find games, available through either third-party sources or the AUR. The [Arch User Repository](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-pattern-lock-screen-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/) (AUR) is a community-driven repository for Arch Linux users that includes many native Linux games.

 Finding and installing native Linux games using the ArchWiki is not very complex. Firstly, visit [ArchWiki's](http://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List%5Fof%5Fgames) List of games page. Then use the search function to look for specific games or browse through the Games category. Once you've found a game you want to install, follow the instructions provided on the page to install it on your Linux PC.

 Remember that AUR packages are maintained by users, so they might not always work perfectly. You might encounter system instability or compatibility issues.
