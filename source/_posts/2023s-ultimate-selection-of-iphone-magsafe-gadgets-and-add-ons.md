##  What MagSafe Accessories Can Do for Your iPhone in 2023

 Those who've been in the Apple ecosystem for a while probably remember the term "[MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/)" used for the easy-release magnetic power cables that used to come with Apple products a few years ago.

 The current-day MagSafe is different. The one that Apple has built into the iPhone 12 onward is meant to facilitate faster cordless charging and uses a ring of magnets embedded in the back of the device to attach to a cordless charger and hold it in place.

 This magnetic ring also makes a handy mount for a variety of other accessories while also charging your device. Apple assures users that MagSafe magnets are shielded and safe to store in your pocket with your debit card, but maybe think twice about throwing your hotel room key in there next to one.

 Since its introduction, a variety of cases and accessories have been made to work with the MagSafe feature on these newer iPhones. Some products work better than others, and you'll want to be sure your accessory actually includes its own ring of magnets that attach to the ones embedded in the iPhone.

 For example, some manufacturers will say their case is "MagSafe compatible," but that will really just mean the case is thin enough for the magnets in the phone to connect to a charging dock. These cases will almost certainly have a weaker hold, and you'll run the risk of your phone disconnecting. If that accessory is supposed to hold the phone up, you are risking your phone taking a nasty fall!

 Apple's line of accessories is made to work with MagSafe, but there are also several strong third-party options out there. This list will cover both, so let's get to it.

| Tons of color and design options     |                                            |

 The [Smartish Gripmunk](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-iPhone-15-MagSafe-Slim-Grip-Protective-Case/dp/B0C7HJ6XM7/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an impressive [iPhone 15 series](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-your-infinix-hot-40-pro-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/) case that youâll love. Itâs reasonably priced and comes in eight color/ \\design options. So, you have plenty of choices to pick one per your aesthetic. If thatâs not enough, the company even allows you to [get your own graphic printed](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-iPhone-15-MagSafe-Slim-Grip-Protective-Case/dp/B0CDMBNMG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) on the Gripmunk.

 The case is excellent at protection and can survive up to 50 drops from a height of six feet without sustaining damage. You also get raised edges around the camera module and on the front to keep all uncovered areas from getting scratched. Plus, there is a microfiber lining to keep the case from scratching your phone.

 In other highlights, the Gripmunk has no trouble with MagSafe accessories as it has built-in magnets to attach compatible accessories. Smartish has also made the sides textured to help with the grip, making it less likely for you to drop the phone accidentally.

Best MagSafe Case

#####  Smartish Gripmunk

Available for all iPhone 15 series models, the Smartish Gripmunk is a solid MagSafe-compatible case with textured sides, raised edges, and a microfiber lining.

![Apple MagSafe Charger on grey background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-magsafe-charger-1.jpg) 

Apple

| Pros                                           | Cons             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Made by Apple, compatibility won't be an issue | Short power cord |
| Charges very quickly (15W)                     |                  |
| Small form factor                              |                  |

 Once again, the official product line takes the honor of 'best' with Apple's [MagSafe Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This puck-shaped charging pad wins for overall charging speed, charging your phone at 15W as opposed to the 7.5W or 5W rates of other products. Its slim design doesn't take much space, and it aligns just right with the MagSafe area on the back of the iPhone for an efficient charge.

 There is one caveat with this charger, howeverâcord length. Apple's MagSafe charger comes with a cord that's only 3.2 feet long, so don't plan on hooking your phone up for a lengthy charge unless you've got an outlet or extension cable nearby.

 Honorable mention in this category goes to the [Sonix Magnetic Link Wireless Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Sonix-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible-Charging/dp/B08R12Z3V5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)âit's almost ten bucks cheaper, charges at a rate of 10W, and the cord is about twice as long as Apple's model.

[Belkin's 3-in-1 Charging Stand](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPGA2ZM/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge-pro-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-magsafe-white) lets you charge everything at the same time. Apple sells this stand through its official store, so you know it'll be properly compatible with MagSafe.

 The aesthetics of Belkin's stand is in line with Apple's signature all-white minimalism. When attached, the iPhone will even appear to float, which is neat looking. There's a branching arm to attach an Apple Watch, and a divot in the base fits AirPods nicely.

 The 3-in-1 wireless charger is one of the pricier products on our list, but it will be worth the cost if you get daily use out of it.

[Belkin's 2-in-1 Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-MagSafe-Wireless-Charger-Charging/dp/B091J7B6X7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for iPhone and AirPods gets an honorable mention here. It's basically the same product, with one less area for charging. So if you don't have an Apple Watch but still like the Belkin stand, this could be a fit for you.

##  Best MagSafe Car Mount: [iOttie Velox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098HD3B4L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![iOttie Velox used in car](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iottie-velox-magsafe.jpg) 

iOttie

| Pros                                                | Cons                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Strong magnetic hold, even with a case              | Cable is built into the charging unit |
| Acts as mount and charger                           |                                       |
| Fairly fast charging rate for a car charger at 7.5W |                                       |
| Includes cigarette-lighter USB adapter              |                                       |

 While there are quite a few MagSafe-compatible car mounts that will hold your phone in place nicely, not many of them also act as a charger. The [iOttie Velox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098HD3B4L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) does both, and while it isn't the fastest charging rate (7.5W), it's still a lifesaver on the road when your battery is low, but you need directions.

 Another plus for this car charger is the included cigarette lighter port adapterâother options similar to the iOttie charger offer an adapter but don't come with one out of the box. If you don't have a car with a USB port built-in, the cigarette lighter adapter comes in extremely handy.

[Reviews say](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23R40270H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) the hold is strong, even with a case, and it stays steady during long rides in the car. The Velox definitely won't disappoint.

 If you want a MagSafe-compatible power bank for on-the-go charging, itâs hard to go wrong with the [Baseus Magnetic Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Baseus-Battery-Wireless-Portable/dp/B09Z6B6681/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This 6,000mAh capacity power bank will offer almost one full charge to any iPhone to survive until you get hold of a power socket. Itâs also relatively compact and attaches easily to all iPhones with MagSafe, including the [iPhone 12 mini](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ltimate-calculus-of-cashflow-from-creativity-measuring-your-youtube-earnings-and-impact-for-2024/) and iPhone 13 mini.

It can deliver up to 7.5W wireless charging and up to 20W wired charging to your iPhone. As it also supports USB PD charging, you can juice the power bank itself within two hours with a power brick rated 18W or higher.

 Among other features, the Baseus offering supports pass-through charging, so you can top up the power bank and your iPhone at the same time. Remember, you wonât get the best charging speeds with the pass-through charging. Plus, you can use the power bank to charge two devices simultaneously, one with wireless charging and the other with wired charging.

| Quality construction materials      |                                        |

 The [MOFT Snap-on Wallet](https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Magnetic-Compatible-Enhanced-Strength/dp/B09K4GVK64?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), compatible with all MagSafe cases, including those for [iPhone 15](https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-make-a-memorable-honeymoon-video/), is perfect for anyone who wants a bit more than a simple card pouch on the back of their device.

 The wallet differs from most MagSafe wallets in a few ways. Firstly, it closes to completely cover the cards inserted into it. And even with a maximum of three cards inside, it remains pleasingly slim on the back of your phone. It also features a stand as part of the hinge that snaps the wallet closed. Open the wallet, and the stand folds out; close the wallet, and it folds flat again.

 If you are familiar with MOFT stands and cases, you will know that the quality of materials isn't something that's scrimped on. The same is true for the wallet, which is constructed from metal, fiberglass, and 16 magnets to ensure it stays firmly secured to your MagSafe case. All that is fully encased in vegan leather, available in colors that range from [Jet Black](https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Magnetic-Compatible-Enhanced-Strength/dp/B09XBBR76H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to [Classic Nude](https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Magnetic-Compatible-Enhanced-Strength/dp/B09K4JLY8B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761895%2Fbest-magsafe-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

[Apple's MagSafe Wallet](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MPPY3ZM/A/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-orange) also deserves to be mentioned, particularly if you want slightly quicker access to your cards. It doesn't include a stand mechanism but is still a great option if you like to keep things sleek and simple.

 Want to film a TikTok or get a timelapse? Joby's [Griptight Tripod Mount](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1662931-REG/joby%5Fgriptight%5Ftripod%5Fmount%5Ffor.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU208295) might be the answer. Unlike other phone tripod mounts or standalone tripods, you don't have to snap your phone into a case or clamp plastic jaws around it.

 Just stick your iPhone to the magnetic attachment, and you're set. It also comes with a pair of jaws you can use for added security if you want to use them, but you shouldn't need to.

 In addition to coming with bendy tripod legs that are fine for most situations, you can mount Joby's attachment [onto multiple other tripods](https://games-able.techidaily.com/mastering-ps5-password-protection-a-step-by-step-guide/). It also has threads you can screw a light or microphone onto when filming, and lets you rotate the phone 360 degrees to capture different angles.

 Honorable mention in this category goes to [Moment's MagSafe tripod](https://partner.shopmoment.com/c/156932/770347/11129?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU208295&subId2=ehtg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-pro-tripod-mount-for-magsafe%2Flandscape-portrait) mount. It lets you mount your iPhone to just about any regular photography tripod but doesn't come with legs like the Joby version.
