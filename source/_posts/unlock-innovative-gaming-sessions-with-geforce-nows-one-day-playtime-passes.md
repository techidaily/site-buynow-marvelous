## Unlock Innovative Gaming Sessions with GeForce NOW's One-Day Playtime Passes

In January, NVIDIA unveiled that it would start offering GeForce Now day passes for gamers, and after a short wait, they're now available starting at $3.99 per day. Here's what you need to know.

 Whether you want to try a game before you buy it, test out the [GeForce NOW Ultimate experience](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-instagram-showcase-video-reversal-techniques-for-2024/), or Steam's 2-hour refund policy isn't quite long enough, a day pass to GeForce Now is the perfect solution. The day passes are available starting today, giving you access to NVIDIA's powerful RTX cloud gaming computer system.

 As promised, GeForce Now day passes start at $3.99 per day, where you'll skip the line and play on premium servers and rigs. The Priority Day pass limits gaming sessions to 6 hours, 1080p HD resolution, and up to 60FPS with no ads.

 However, if you want to kick things up a notch, try the Ultimate Day Pass for $7.99\. Once you pay, you'll be rocking an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 cloud computer rig capable of a 4K resolution and 120 FPS. The more expensive Ultimate pass includes exclusive priority access to RTX 4080 servers and longer 8-hour gaming sessions.

 With over 1,800+ titles in the [GeForce Now game library](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/games/), there's no shortage of entertainment to take advantage of. More importantly, the Day Passes are arriving at the perfect time, as the library has new titles, including _Undisputed_, _The Thaumaturge, Taxi Life, Winter Survival,_ and _Zoria: Age of Shattering,_ to name a few. 

 Sure, you can always take advantage of the GeForce Now free service, but it's somewhat limited in computing power, and short 1-hour gaming limits, not to mention ads. By being able to drop $4 on a day pass, you'll get the whole experience while being able to play a wide collection of content. This is a great way to try longer games before buying them, and for many titles, you can beat the entire game within 6-8 hours.

 If you already have a high-end gaming PC, this is a great way to try games, and for everyone else, it gives you the power needed for the best gameplay. Essentially, GeForce Now Day passes are an all-new way to play.
