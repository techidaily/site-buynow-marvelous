 Pros

* Customizable RGB lighting
* Micro-textured surface for precision
* Comfortable

 Cons

* Synchronized lighting feature is available only for some games

 Razer's Goliathus 36.2 x 11.6-inch gaming mat has a thin border of customizable RGB lighting to surround your keyboard and mouse. It uses Razer Chroma software and includes a dizzying number of colors—16.8 million, to be exact, plus tons of animated effects—so you can set it to match your rig perfectly. Gamers can even synchronize it with a select list of games and apps to provide immersive, responsive lighting effects along with the action.

 The pad's surface is covered in micro-textured cloth to allow for precise tracking, no matter what mouse you use. The underside has a layer of grippy rubber to prevent sliding, so everything stays where it's supposed to.

 Razer also sells mice and keyboards with Chroma software if you want to make your setup even more coordinated.

 Pros

* Two-zone RGB lighting
* Works for low and high DPI settings
* Good for gaming

 Cons

* Not as wide as some other options

 The SteelSeries QcK Prism XL is our runner-up for best overall, but it was a very close call, given this mat has so many solid features at a reasonable price. While 35.4 x 11.8 inches is about an inch narrower than many other pads on our list, this mouse pad is still large enough to fit all your peripherals.

 There are also different sizes if you like the mouse pad but want to go even bigger. All the pads have a micro-woven cloth top to ensure reasonable control in high and low DPI setups. Movement feels smooth and accurate as you play games.

 Some people may find RGB distracting during games. Still, you can set up the two-zone RGB dynamic illumination to provide important in-game information, such as damage, ammo capacity, and more. One negative is that you will need other SteelSeries equipment to utilize PrismSync technology fully.

 Pros

* Optimized for high-DPI gaming mice
* Option for thicker padding
* Affordable

 Cons

* Strong rubber smell out of the box

 The Corsair MM300 Anti-Fray Mouse Pad measures 36.6 x 11.8 inches and foregoes the ultra-sleek spaceship aesthetic for something more textured. The fabric top has a low-friction weave for precise tracking designed for high-DPI mice (laser and optical).

 The surface has a pre-worn pattern, a little welcome grunge for people who aren't necessarily about RGB. The edges of the mouse pad have heavy stitching to prevent fraying, and the base is a layer of non-slip rubber, so when you set it on your desk, it stays there.

 These Corsair mouse pads also come in a "Thick" size, which puts 0.2 inches of squishy rubber between your mouse and desk. They're an excellent option for anyone who wants to smooth over an uneven surface or wants extra cushioning while they game. The price for the number of different options and thickness makes this our pick for the best value.

**Size** : 36.6 x 11.8 inches |**Material** : Cloth |**Lighting/Ports** : None |**Additional Features** : Options for extra padding, spill-proof coating

 Pros

* Moderate friction for mouse feedback
* Includes carrying case
* Neutral design

 Cons

* Surface attracts lint

 If you want something with a subtle design, the Logitech G840 XL mouse pad sports an all-black surface with just a hint of blue on the edges. It measures 35.4 x 15.6 inches and 0.11 inches thick to provide enough cushioning while remaining low-profile and rollable. It even comes with a transport tube.

 While some extra-large mouse pads advertise super low-friction surfaces, slipperiness can make mouse movements feel imprecise or more challenging to control for some gamers. The G840 XL offers moderate friction to give you more feedback on your mouse movements, and the cloth surface is tuned for superior tracking consistency.

 Like several other mouse pads on this list, the G840 XL has a rubber backing that prevents slipping and sliding on your gaming surface.

 Pros

* Low-profile stitched edges
* Very durable surface
* Larger size than most

 Cons

* Tends to slide a bit

 This ROG Sheath mouse pad from ASUS is a bit larger than most of the options on this list, measuring 35.4 x 17.3 inches and about 0.12 inches thick, but it’s all about precision. The woven surface makes for precise mouse tracking and minimal friction. Even the stitched borders are as low-profile as possible to prevent that bumper car effect if your mouse gets too close to the edge. That stitching also guards against fraying.

 The ROG Sheath has undergone lots of durability testing to ensure that the pad’s surface will hold up under repeated swipes of your mouse. It’s also temperature resistant (up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) to withstand even the hottest PC. The one downside is that this pad is lightweight enough to slide around a bit with a smooth desk surface. It has a rubber backing to cut down on this kind of movement.

 Pros

* Anti-fray edges
* Optimized for optical mouse tracking
* Durable

 Cons

* Surface might be too slippery for some

 The Fury S mouse pad from HyperX is available in different sizes and color options. You can also choose between various surfaces: One optimized for speed and the other for precision. We've selected the XL version (35.4 x 16.5 inches) in the speed edition, which means it's covered in a densely woven cloth designed to be as low-friction as possible.

 The Fury S mouse pad won't slow down if you're about quick reflexes. It works best with optical mice.

 Like some other mouse pads on this list, the Fury S Speed Edition has stitched edges to prevent fraying and a non-slip rubber backing to hold it in place on your gaming surface. It's about 0.16 inches thick, thicker than many options on this list.

 Pros

* Water resistant
* Fray resistant
* Smooth mouse movement

 Cons

* May show lint and dust

 The Corsair MM350 Pro Premium is a mouse pad that wants to stick with you for a long time. We chose the Extended XL Spill-proof version for our selection of best for durability. The Corsair MM350 is a good size, measuring 36.6 x 15.7 inches, and has an ideal thickness of 0.15 inches, which is definitely on the thicker end for most mouse pads.

 There are stitched edges that hold up to the movements of your arms and prevent the edges from fraying. However, over a long period of use, you may see some mild edge fraying, but you likely won’t see fraying on the actual mouse pad surface. The spill-proof and stain-resistant coating works well and will wipe clean easily.

 The bottom has a rubber coating to prevent slipping, which works as it should, especially considering the heavier weight of the pad has to it. Overall, this mouse pad should last you for a long time and go through many gaming sessions.

 Pros

* Simple, clean design
* Thick
* Customizable through Razer website

 Cons

* No stitched edge

 When purchasing a budget extended mouse pad, you want to feel like you’re getting the best quality possible for a lower price and not buying a cheap imitation. The Razer Gigantus V2 retails at $30 for the XXL version, but it still feels like Razer made it with great care and quality.

 The Gigantus V2 measures 37 x 10.83 inches and has a thickness of 0.15 inches, which feels comfortable under your arms. The textured micro-weave surface has the right balance between grip and slide for your mouse, ensuring accuracy, while the rubber anti-slip base holds everything in place.

 The mouse pad has a simple black and green look, but the Razer website allows you to pick a design you like and add your Gamertag for fun. There is no stitched edging, so there is the possibility of fraying, but this is a well-made mouse pad that’s worth the money.

## What to Look For in an Extended Mouse Pad

 While some extended mouse pads have extra-thick padding for comfort, others have different surface options prioritizing speed or control. You can also choose if you want low or moderate friction, impacting how much you feel the surface under your hand.

 If you aren’t serious about these details, you can prioritize aesthetics and go with a pad matching your setup. Choose from bold graphics, subdued neutrals, and customizable lighting options to complete your gaming station.

### Dimensions

 Measure your desk space before upgrading from a regular mouse pad to one with extended dimensions. It should be able to fit under your keyboard with some room to spare and should provide plenty of space around your mouse to move freely.

 Most of the mousepads on this list are among the largest offered by these brands—if they seem too big for your setup, check and see if the item is available in medium or large dimensions rather than extra-large.

### Surface Friction

 The amount of friction you want from your mouse pad depends mainly on your preferences and play style. Generally speaking, low-DPI gamers prefer moderate friction because it improves control and makes it easier to stop the mouse after fast bursts of movement. High-DPI gamers often prefer low friction because it allows precise movement and speed.

 But there are no hard and fast rules. If you like to “feel” the gaming surface under your mouse, look for something slightly more texture. If you want to zip around on a super-smooth surface, check out low-friction mouse pads that prioritize speed.

### Durability

 If you buy better quality, you’ll buy less often. This gear gets used a lot and can undergo a lot of wear. Stitched or bonded edges can help prevent fraying and improve longevity. Water and heat resistance can also prevent fading, staining, and bad smells.

 FAQ

* Is it bad to use a mouse without a pad?  
 Yes, mice are designed to work best with a mouse pad. The pad prevents the mouse from being damaged by rubbing over your desk surface and also protects your desk from wear and tear from the mouse. Most mice today are either[optical or laser mice](https://www.lifewire.com/whats-the-difference-between-optical-and-laser-mice-2640209) , and their sensors can read mouse pad material better than other surfaces like wood or glass.
* Are extended mouse pads worth it?  
 Absolutely. An extended mouse pad will prevent your mouse from running off the edge of your mouse pad when you’re excitedly playing a match, and it will also hold up to more wear than a standard mouse pad. These mousepads also provide excellent protection for your desk and are a great look for your gaming station.
* What mouse pad do pro gamers use?  
 Many pro gamers are sponsored so that they will use a brand of mouse pad affiliated with their sponsorship. However, pro gamers may prefer extended mouse pads for comfort and performance. If you like a flash appearance, a mousepad with RGB lighting always lends a bit of style.
