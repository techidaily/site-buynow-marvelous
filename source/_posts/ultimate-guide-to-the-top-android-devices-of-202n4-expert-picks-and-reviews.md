##  How to Shop For an Android Phone in 2024

 There are a lot of things to consider when buying a new phone. If you're here, you're already considering Android, so that's one big decision out of the way. Android devices offer more flexibility than [iPhones](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-vimeo-transformation-tips-easy-to-create-gifs/) (with Apple's closed ecosystem), and there are many more phones to choose from.

 We'll be throwing a lot of technical jargon at you in this list, including specs like processors, [RAM](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-unlocking-youtube-success-top-video-strategies-to-explode-views/), [megapixels](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), [refresh rates](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/top-11-solutions-to-locate-missing-airpods-on-find-my-apple-feature/), and more. The good news is you don't necessarily need to worry about all the tech specifications. There's not one single "spec" that makes or breaks a phone—it's more about the complete package, and the additional specifications are nice bonuses.

| Pros                                 | Cons                                     |

| Same performance as larger models    |                                          |

 Samsung’s Galaxy S range of phones has long been some of the very best Android phones you can buy. With the latest range, you can’t go wrong with any model, but the [Samsung Galaxy S24](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDKX76Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the most compact while still packing all the key features that make this line so great. That makes this an easy shoo-in for our choice of the best overall Android phone for most people.

 In the United States, the Galaxy S24 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, while in the rest of the world, you get the Samsung-designed Exynos 2400 chipset. Either way, you get plenty of processing power, most of which goes to powering the phone’s various AI features. While the Qualcomm processor may have a slight advantage, it’s just that—slight.

 Looking at the display, the 6.2-inch [AMOLED](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-lightning-fast-windowed-photo-reader-for-win11/) display is every bit as sharp and colorful as you’d expect in a Samsung phone. While the resolution is somewhat lower than on the Plus and Ultra models, the smaller screen keeps this from being overly noticeable. The display uses [Gorilla Glass Victus 2](https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/glass-types/gorilla-glass-victus-2.html), the same as the [S24 Plus model](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDL3BPL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but not quite as tough as the Gorilla Armor on the [Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDL3H3P?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The one area where the Galaxy S24 base model doesn’t compare to the Plus and Ultra models is the camera, but this is only by comparison. While the two pricier models do have more impressive camera arrays, the S24's camera functionality is still superior to its predecessor, thanks to improvements to Samsung’s ProVisual engine.

 One of the major aspects of the new Galaxy phones that Samsung is heavily focusing on is its Galaxy AI features. While convenient options like Circle to Search highlight the AI integration, other features like Note Assist and near-instant translation between languages are also major steps forward for the product line.

 The Samsung Galaxy S24 is available with either 128GB or 256GB storage. It’s available in four color variations: [Amber Yellow](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDKX76Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Cobalt Violet](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDRFVTL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Marble Gray](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDLJR6K/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or [Onyx Black](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDTFNGM/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

Best Android Phone Overall

#####  Samsung Galaxy S24

The Samsung Galaxy S24 may be the smallest in the line, but it has big-time processing power and a fantastic camera, perfect for selfies, group shots, and more.

| Pros                                         | Cons                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Fantastic performance for the price          | Limited onboard storage |
| More powerful hardware than the 2023 version |                         |
| Solid battery life                           |                         |

[Budget phones have come a long way](https://change-location.techidaily.com/the-magnificent-art-of-pokemon-go-streaming-on-vivo-t2x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). Even just 10 years ago, they were best avoided in many cases, but now they’re often as feature-packed as their flagship cousins, with just a few minor cuts to save money. With its sharp display and features like [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) sound, the [Motorola Moto G Play (2024)](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g-play-gen-3%2Fp) is a perfect example of a great Android phone that just happens to cost less.

 On the hardware front, the Moto G Play is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 640 4G mobile chipset, which uses a Kryo GPU. This, combined with the 4GB of RAM (6GB with the RAM Boost feature) and 64GB of storage, means that while it isn’t the speediest on the market, it’s far from slow.

 The display uses a 6.5-inch panel with a resolution of 1600x720 for a relatively sharp pixel density of 269ppi. It is protected by [Gorilla Glass 3](https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/glass-types/gorilla-glass-3-with-ndr.html), which means it should be relatively scratch-resistant. Motorola also claims the Moto G Play is water-resistant but doesn’t list an [IP rating](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/), so you should be careful to keep it as dry as possible.

 Battery life shouldn’t be much of a worry thanks to the 5,000mAh battery, which Motorola claims can give you up to 46 hours of juice. When it comes time to top up, the phone is 15W charging capable, so you shouldn’t need to wait long to charge.

| Pros                                | Cons                        |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Every bit as speedy as the Pixel 7  | Pricier than previous model |
| Display now has a 90Hz refresh rate | Plastic back                |
| Wireless charging                   |                             |

 Quality mid-range phones are difficult to find between the higher-priced premium phones and a sea of mediocre budget phones. Google's Pixel A-series has been one of the best options in this class for years, and with the [Google Pixel 7a](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the line is better than ever before.

 While the [Pixel 8a](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQFJSRF?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has been released, [we still recommend the Pixel 7a at this time](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/simplified-guide-posting-igtv-on-stories-for-2024/). The Pixel 8a does offer some upgrades over the 7a, but the cost with the limited number of upgrades makes it difficult to recommend for most people over the previous model, which is often available at a discount. You can read more about this in our [Pixel 8a review](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-content-creation-evolution-studio-vs-innovative-beta/). This may change as time goes on and stock of the 7a becomes more scarce.

 As has been the case with previous Pixel generations, the Pixel 7a shares the same chipset as the 7—the Google Tensor G2\. However, unlike the Pixel 6 and 6a, the Pixel 7a now has the same 8GB RAM you'll find inside the Pixel 7\. The only major difference in specs is that you can choose from 256GB of storage on the Pixel 7 instead of the lone 128GB option on the Pixel 7a.

 Aside from size, differences have also largely disappeared when it comes to the screens. The Pixel 7a has a 6.1-inch screen, as opposed to the 6.3-inch screen on the Pixel 7\. That said, while the previous generation limited the Pixel 6a to a 60Hz refresh rate, the 7a has the same 90Hz refresh rate as the 7.

 The Google Pixel 7 has a larger camera sensor than the 7a, but the megapixel count is higher on all three of the 7a's lenses. Pixel 7a features 64MP wide and 13MP ultra-wide cameras on the rear, with a 13MP front lens. The angle on the ultra-wide lens is also wider than the 7's.

 Something unique to phones from Google, as opposed to other manufacturers, is that you can be sure you'll have the latest updates on OS upgrades as soon as they're available. You may find yourself waiting months for phone updates from other manufacturers, especially with their mid-range and entry-level offerings.

 On top of that, plenty of Pixel-exclusive features will never come to other Android devices, as mentioned in our [Google Pixel 7a review](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-secrets-to-parallel-playback-prowess-for-2024/), like Now Playing, which automatically listens to music playing in the background and displays the title and artist on your lock screen. There is also [Google Assistant-powered call assist features](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-redux-of-graphics-amd-radeon-update/) that sit on hold for you, screen incoming calls from unknown numbers, and so much more.

 The Google Pixel 7a retails for $50 more than the previous generation, but the slight price increase is easier to swallow with all these upgrades. The phone is available in three color options: [Charcoal](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Sea](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9T8R41?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Snow](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9R47PC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

Best Mid-Range Android Phone

The Pixel A-series have always been great mid-range phones, but the Google Pixel 7a is better than ever, with the same Tensor G2 chipset, 8GB RAM, and 90Hz display as the Pixel 7.

| Excellent performance and AI features                 | Squared-off design won’t be for everyone |
| Better camera array than the other S24 models         |                                          |

 While Samsung makes plenty of flagship-level phones across its various categories, there’s no doubt that for many people, the S-series Ultra phones are the true flagship. This remains true for the [Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDNKZ92/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), though much of what makes this phone so great lies not in the hardware but in the same software that powers all three of the S24 line of phones.

 That said, as our [review of the Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-profit-strategies-for-vimeo-content-creators/) shows, that hardware is nothing to write off. The Snapdragon chipset in the U.S. version of the phone is quite powerful, and while the Samsung Exynos-powered version isn’t quite as quick, many of these differences are only noticeable when benchmarking the phones side-by-side. You’ll likely never notice a difference in performance in day-to-day use.

 The display is the first major area where the Galaxy S24 Ultra stands out above and beyond the rest of the S24 line. To start, this is the largest model of the phone, with a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display. This has the same 2,600 nits of max brightness as the rest of the line but uses Gorilla Armor instead of the slightly more scratch-prone Gorilla Glass Victus 2 found on the other two models.

 This model also has the most impressive camera array of the S24 lineup. The main camera on the Ultra is a 200MP unit compared to just 50MP on the S24 and S24+. As with the other two phones, Samsung’s improved ProVisual engine makes for a noticeable upgrade over the camera performance in the S23 generation.

 As with the base-level S24, Galaxy AI plays a big part of Samsung’s strategy with the S24 Ultra. With intelligent features that help improve your photos, quickly summarize web pages into notes, and other smart features, it almost feels like a personal assistant when the S24 Ultra is at its best.

 You can buy the S24 Ultra with either 256GB or 512GB of onboard storage. The phone is available in four color options: [Titanium Black](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Titanium Gray](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDWC436/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Titanium Violet](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDPJ8Y8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Titanium Yellow](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDNKZ92/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| Speedy performance and effective cooling       | Aesthetic won’t be for everyone |

| Available in multiple finishes                 |                                 |

 While any modern phone is fine for playing the occasional casual game, that isn’t enough for someone who takes mobile gaming seriously. RedMagic has been making high-performance gaming phones for years, complete with overpowered hardware and serious cooling. The [RedMagic 9 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Smartphone-Snapdragon-Dual-Sim-Unlocked/dp/B0CP7KJQD5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the company’s latest gaming-centric phone and is the best to date.

 Performance is paramount for a gaming phone, and the hardware powering the RedMagic 9 Pro has performance in spades. The chipset is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, augmented with RedMagic’s Red Core 2 Pro gaming chip. The phone also uses UFS 4.0 for speedy loading and LPDDR5X RAM for quick memory access.

 The display is a 6.8-inch FHD+ Full AMOLED screen with an HD+ resolution of 2480 × 1116\. While the display only handles frame rates of up to 120 frames per second, the 960Hz touch sampling rate means that response time feels instantaneous, which is key for faster-paced games where millisecond timing can make the difference between winning and losing.

 If you’ve ever played a demanding game on a phone, you’ve probably noticed how fast it can heat up. To combat this, the RedMagic 9 Pro has a built-in high-speed fan, just like a gaming PC. This needs some extra power, so the phone is equipped with a massive 6,500mAh battery.

 You have a few choices regarding the RedMagic 9 Pro’s specs. The base model is available in black and has 12GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage. If you need more RAM and storage space, you can also choose the version with 16GB RAM and 512GB onboard storage, which comes in [Silver](https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Smartphone-Snapdragon-Dual-Sim-Unlocked/dp/B0CP7N2L7L/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Transparent](https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Smartphone-Snapdragon-Dual-Sim-Unlocked/dp/B0CP7K5NJ9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209611&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734936%2Fbest-android-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color varieties.

Best Android Phone for Gaming

#####  REDMAGIC 9 Pro

If your phone is a gaming machine first and everything else second, the RedMagic 9 Pro is the phone for you. Not only does it have power to offer in spades, but it has some serious onboard cooling to make sure you’re not overheating your hands during your game time.

##  Best Android Camera Phone: [Google Pixel 8 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F8%5Fpro?hl=en-US) 

![Front facing selfie camera on the Google Pixel 8 Pro](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/53249989349_531796845c_o.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek  

| **Pros**                    | **Cons**                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Incredible suite of cameras | Lackluster battery life |
| Vibrant display             |                         |
| Tensor G3 chip              |                         |

 The Pixel seems to get better with every generation, and that trend continues with the [Pixel 8 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F8%5Fpro?hl=en-US). Offering a robust set of cameras and plenty of processing power thanks to the Tensor G3, there's a lot to love about the latest Pixel flagship.

 One of the big draws of the Pixel 8 Pro is its photography chops. Inside you'll find a 50 MP main camera, 48MP ultrawide, 48 MP telephoto, and a 10.5 MP front camera for selfies. These take incredible photos—and they've been optimized to perform exceptionally well in low-light environments. Toss in access to Pro Controls to make tweaks to settings like shutter speed and ISO, and it's a compelling replacement for your camera.

 Viewing your pictures looks great on the vibrant 6.7-inch display, and using the phone is a smooth experience because of its new Tensor G3 chip. All these features are a drag on battery life, however, so power users can expect to need a recharge at the end of a typical workday. Beyond that, there's little to dislike about this premium Android smartphone.

 If you value battery life, choosing the right phone can be difficult, as phones that focus on battery life often make sacrifices elsewhere. In this case, there’s no need to worry: The [ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro](https://shop.asus.com/us/rog/rog-phone-8-pro.html) is a monster phone, not just a phone with monster battery life.

 The ROG Phone 8 Pro features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SM8650 chipset and Adreno 750 GPU, complete with Snapdragon sound. The standard edition of the phone has 16GB RAM and a hefty 512GB storage. The display is a 6.78-inch screen with a resolution of 2400 x 1080.

 The phone uses a dual battery array that offers the equivalent of a 5,500mAh standard battery. While that may not sound huge, ASUS claims that this battery can get you up to 23 hours of video playback, 3.4 hours of heavy gaming, or 17 hours of scrolling through Instagram.

 When it comes to charging, you won’t be waiting around long, regardless of how you charge. The phone doesn’t just come with a charger—and increasingly rare inclusion—but a 65-watt HyperCharge USB PD charger. This will completely charge the phone in just 39 minutes. The phone also supports 15-watt wireless charging.

 There are two different versions of the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro available. The standard model is everything we’ve talked about above, while the [ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition bumps](https://shop.asus.com/us/90ai00n3-m00180-rog-phone-8-pro.html) the RAM up to 24GB and the onboard storage to 1TB. Both models are only available in a Phantom Black colorway.

### Should I buy an Android phone or an iPhone?

 Both types of phones are incredibly popular. iPhones tend to be more streamlined, while Android phones offer more customization options. You'll also find more Android phones to choose from, as they're produced by several companies (such as Google, Samsung, and ASUS) whereas iPhones are only made by Apple.

### Can you use an Apple Watch with an Android phone?

 You can technically [use an Apple Watch with Android](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-definitive-playbook-enhancing-your-videos-first-impression/), but you'll need an iPhone to finish the setup phase. You'll also miss out on a ton of features that are exclusive to iPhone. In other words, it's not recommended.
