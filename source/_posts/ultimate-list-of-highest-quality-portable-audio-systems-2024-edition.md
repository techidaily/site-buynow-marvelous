##  How to Choose the Best Portable Speaker in 2024

 Choosing the best portable speaker will come down to when and where you want to use it. Naturally, size will be key, as you'll want something with a high portability factor, and this is a good place to start.

 As a general rule of thumb, the larger the speaker, the more powerful the sound output is likely to be. However, this will likely mean some trade-off regarding how portable it is. In contrast, smaller speakers are much more portable, but you can expect their sound output to be significantly less powerful.

 If you plan on taking your portable speaker to the beach or the pool, you'll need to ensure it has a good waterproof rating to guard against splash and dirt damage.

[Water resistance ratings](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) are classified with an Ingress Protection (IP) factor containing two digits. The first digit refers to the effectiveness against foreign materials (such as dust), and the second refers to how waterproof the product is. You should ideally look at speakers with an IP67 rating or higher to ensure your speaker can survive the elements.

 Consider the battery life of portable speakers as well, as you'll want to ensure they can last and won't give out halfway through the day. Finally, look at the extra features offered by portable speakers. Do they have voice assistant compatibility? Can they be paired with a second speaker for stereo sound?

 Whatever type of portable speaker you're looking for, there's certainly no shortage of choice. Below, we've selected some of the best portable speakers currently available to suit a variety of budgets and requirements.

##  Best Portable Speaker Overall: [Sonos Move 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CGGJHZSM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003006&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-portable-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Sonos Move 2 sitting on a dirt patch in front of flowers](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/53197064810_f154131bfd_o.jpg) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ✓ Amazing sound quality                     | ✗ Expensive         |
| ✓ Optimizes sound to suit your surroundings | ✗ On the bulky side |
| ✓ Alexa built-in                            |                     |
| ✓ IP56 water resistant                      |                     |

 Released in Fall 2023, the [Sonos Move 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CGGJHZSM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003006&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-portable-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an updated version of the [Sonos Move](https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Move-Battery-Powered-Bluetooth-Built/dp/B089DPZR96?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003006&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-portable-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and boasts an improved battery life and an additional tweeter compared to its predecessor.

 Regarding audio, the Move 2 is one of the best portable speakers money can buy. With an extra tweeter added to the mix, the crisp highs and mids mix flawlessly with deep, dynamic bass tones. Automatic Trueplay tuning also continuously optimizes the soundscape to suit your surroundings.

 This speaker has Alexa built-in, so you can enjoy complete voice assistant control. It provides a respectable 24 hours of playback at full charge. You also get a wireless charging base with a detachable adapter, giving you the added convenience of charging it from just about anywhere. With the [Sonos app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003006/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/controller-app), you can combine all your content and manage it easily from one place.

 While the Sonos Move 2 is classified as portable, its bulkier frame (coupled with its sizable price tag) means you'll probably not cart this one around on your next camping trip.

 An IP56 rating means it's protected against spills or splashes, and its shock-absorbent casing means it can withstand the odd knock here and there. But really, the big draw here is the high-fidelity stereo sound. For all its bells and whistles, the Sonos Move 2 delivers where it counts—with its incredible sound.

| Pros                                        | Cons                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Affordable                                | ✗ Not as powerful as some alternatives |
| ✓ IP67 waterproof                           |                                        |
| ✓ UV coating                                |                                        |
| ✓ Can connect two speakers for stereo sound |                                        |

 The [Sony SRS-XB100](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Lightweight-Super-Compact-Extra-Durable-Waterproof/dp/B0C296VD7T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003006&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-portable-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a truly portable speaker. Weighing just 9.7 ounces, this compact speaker is light enough to be taken anywhere and comes with a strap mount, allowing it to be easily attached to the outside of a bag. The speaker runs for up to 16 hours on a full charge and is rated IP67 water and dustproof. It also has a UV coating that provides extra protection against the elements.

 For its budget-friendly price point, the SRS-XB100 is an impressive device. Its 2.5-watt speaker delivers surprisingly rich sound thanks to a sound diffusion processor, which spreads the sound further, allowing it to cover a larger space. And if you're craving an extra bit of oompf, you can connect two SRS-XB100s and enjoy stereo sound in the great outdoors.

 A built-in mic can be used for hands-free voice calls, and its echo-canceling technology enables two people to speak simultaneously without the sound cutting out. With crystal clear voice chat, you can make or take that all-important call distortion-free and get back to your music even faster.

 Sony's Fast Pair technology provides a strong, stable wireless connection for streaming your tunes from anywhere, and convenient USB-C charging means it can easily be charged in the car or via a power bank while in transit.

 The Sony SRS-XB100 is made from partially recycled plastic, which is great news for the environmentally conscious. It is also available in a range of colors.

[$48 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Lightweight-Super-Compact-Extra-Durable-Waterproof/dp/B0C296VD7T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003006&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-portable-speakers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

##  Best Portable Speaker: [JBL Xtreme 4](https://uk.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/XTREME-4.html?cgid=bluetooth-portables)

JBL

| Pros                       | Cons                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ✓ Big, powerful audio      | ✗ Expensive             |
| ✓ 24 hours of battery life | ✗ Not the most discreet |
| ✓ IP67 waterproof          |                         |
| ✓ AI Sound Boost feature   |                         |

 If you're looking for a portable speaker to bring the party with you wherever you go, then the [JBL Xtreme 4](https://uk.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/XTREME-4.html?cgid=bluetooth-portables) is more than up to the challenge. With two woofers, two drivers, and dual JBL bass radiators, this one is guaranteed to get the party started. In addition to its powerful sound, the JBL Xtreme 4 has an IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, meaning it can comfortably perform in any outdoor conditions.

 The JBL Xtreme 4 is roughly the same size as a small sports bag, but despite its larger size, it still scores high in the portability stakes, thanks to its convenient shoulder strap. It provides a massive 24 hours of playtime on a full charge, which can be increased by six additional hours with the Playtime Boost function.

 Plus, if you want things to get loud enough to wake the gods, you can pair two JBL Xtreme 4 speakers for powerful stereo sound. Using the Auracast feature, multiple JBL speakers can be connected, and you can even use the [JBL Portable app](https://support.jbl.com/my/en/howto/jbl-portable-app-pc-information-apac/000021087.html) to pair your Xtreme 4 with other JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers. This is an excellent feature if you want your party to have the same vibe indoors as it has outdoors.

 Additionally, the JBL Xtreme 4 has an ace up its sleeve with its AI Sound Boost feature. This uses an AI-powered algorithm to predict loudspeaker movement and power response. It emphasizes bass output and increases the overall volume while maintaining crisp audio quality. However, be warned. With great power comes great responsibility, and you'll want to make sure that if you're using this feature, there's a respectable distance between you and your nearest neighbors.

 The JBL Xtreme 4 is a powerful, portable party speaker perfect for larger gatherings. Its hefty sound output may come with a similarly hefty price tag, but if you're looking for a portable speaker that can handle a larger outdoor space, this could be the one for you.

Engineered to provide 360-degree sound, it boasts an IP67 waterproof rating and can even float. Capable of withstanding full submersion for up to 30 minutes, it's ideal for a trip to the beach or the pool or for taking into the shower.

 This Bluetooth speaker has a range of 180 feet and will keep those tunes pumping for up to 17 hours on a full charge. It has a built-in Outdoor Boost feature that recalibrates the audio output to better suit outdoor acoustics and a customizable EQ that you can tinker with via the UE BOOM app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003006/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logitech.ueboom&hl=en%5FUS) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ue-boom/id632344648). This includes several presets, such as a Deep Relaxation Mode, Podcast Mode, and Gaming Mode.

 Another feature on the BOOM app is the PartyUp function, which pairs your EPICBOOM with another for fuller stereo sound. This same feature works with other Ultimate Ears portable speakers, such as the BOOM, MEGABOOM, and HYPERBOOM models, and is handy for facilitating an audio boost for larger gatherings.

 The EPICBOOM is incompatible with voice assistants and does not connect with the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM series, so bear these factors in mind if you're considering this portable speaker. Its price tag also places it firmly in the premium range. However, if you're specifically looking for a portable speaker that can handle getting wet and sounds great, the Ultimate Ears EPICBOOM is a worthy investment.

##  Best Compact Portable Speaker: [Tribit StormBox Flow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CCJ3XHK5)

| Pros                            | Cons                                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Reasonably affordable         | ✗ Not the best-looking portable speaker |
| ✓ Up to 30 hours of playback    |                                         |
| ✓ IP67 waterproof               |                                         |
| ✓ XBass feature adds some oompf |                                         |

 At first glance, the [Tribit StormBox Flow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CCJ3XHK5) resembles your Dad's old boombox. But luckily, it's a bit more sophisticated than that. Instead, this compact and portable Bluetooth speaker with XBass technology boasts an impressive 30-hour battery life and can keep you happily connected to your music, audiobooks, and podcasts, whether you're home or away.

 Besides offering a solid Bluetooth 5.3 connection with a 100-foot range, the Stormbox Flow has an IP67 waterproof rating and can take the odd splash damage in its stride. That XBass feature provides an additional 9db of bass whenever needed, providing a more immersive listening experience. Naturally, you can expect a bit of a trade-off on battery life with XBass engaged, but you'll still get around 24 hours of playback.

 Using the [Tribit app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003006/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thousandshores.tribit&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US), you can customize the EQ on the Stormbox Flow and fine-tune everything to match your surroundings. You can also find EQ presets for XBass and Audiobook Mode, with music settings for Jazz, Rock, and Classical playlists here. Additionally, you can pair two speakers to enjoy Tribit's Party Mode and double the volume for your social gatherings.

 There's a built-in microphone for hands-free voice calls and voice assistant control, and the device itself can be fully charged in four hours via the USB-C port. For added portability, the Stormbox Flow is fitted with a carry strap clipped to a bag or looped around your wrist.

 The Stormbox Flow offers decent functionality with excellent audio quality for the asking price. It's well-equipped for outdoor use, particularly with its XBass feature, and compact enough to be easily slipped inside a bag or large pocket. And for less than $80, this Bluetooth speaker easily outshines Dad's old radio.

## FAQ

### Does a portable speaker need Bluetooth to work?

 There are two types of wireless speakers: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, with many options offering both types of connectivity. Both options will work fine inside the home, or anywhere that's a Wi-Fi hotspot. However, once you move beyond the wireless range, you'll need to connect to your portable speaker via Bluetooth to continue streaming audio through your smartphone or tablet.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Does a portable speaker need Wi-Fi to work?

 Most portable speakers don't need Wi-Fi to operate, as most of them can connect via Bluetooth to your chosen device. However, connecting your speaker via Wi-Fi will provide you with the benefit of better audio, as there are fewer limitations compared to Bluetooth.

 With a Wi-Fi speaker, data can be transferred at much faster speeds than with Bluetooth and isn't subject to the same data compression process as Bluetooth is. However, Wi-Fi speakers require an internet connection to function, whereas Bluetooth speakers do not.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Can I bring a portable speaker on a plane?

 Yes - although there are one or two caveats to this. You'll need to check that your speaker doesn't exceed the size and weight limits for your carry-on luggage if you want to avoid having to pay supplementary fees.

 In addition, you will not be able to use your speaker on the plane during take-off or landing and will need to consider the comfort of the other passengers if you're planning to use your speaker in flight.

 Consider connecting your speaker to Bluetooth headphones to show consideration for other people's privacy. If this isn't possible, ensure that you are using your speaker on a low-volume setting, and perhaps ask for the consent of those sitting near you before you use your speaker.

### Why is my portable speaker cutting out?

 There's a short checklist of possible reasons for this. They include lack of battery charge, interference, obstruction, or distance from the Wi-Fi router.

 You may have strayed beyond your speaker's Bluetooth range, other networks may be causing interference to the signal resulting in an intermittent transmission, or they may be physical objects such as walls that are causing a disruption.
