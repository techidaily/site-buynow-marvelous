## Experience the Wonders of Web Prehistory with Google's New Lego-Inspired Chrome Dino Collection

When your Internet goes down, you've probably seen the Chrome dinosaur pop up on your screen. You know him all too well. But the one game he's involved in? It can get boring after a while. If you'd like to do another dinosaur-related activity while you wait for an internet outage to resolve, what about putting together a dinosaur built of blocks?

 Google has a cool new way for people to experience its Chrome Dino game. The company has recently launched [the "Chrome Dino Brick Set"](https://shop.merch.google/product/lifestyle/chrome-dino-brick-set-ggoegfnh228499?itemListName=Category) through its official merchandise store. This LEGO-like set allows users to build the beloved pixelated dinosaur character from the offline game. It's not actual LEGO, so they're also not overly expensiveâ€”the whole set is just $40\. Who doesn't love some block building?

 The set consists of 233 pieces. While Google hasn't provided specific dimensions for the assembled model, if the pieces are at all similar to the sizes of LEGO blocks, this should be a pretty decently medium/big model. The Dino is constructed entirely in green, featuring a transparent base and a single white eye, staying true to its digital counterpart.

 However, this set is only available limited quantities, with approximately 600 sets up for grabs on the online store. As of the time of writing, there are 580 units remaining, so you might want to grab one sometime soon if you're interested. Google's merchandise store is known for taking time to restock popular items, and it's not known if this will restock at all. It has also recently introduced other items like tote bags, duffel bags, pickleball bags, and a peculiar "Mewgler" cat plush, so it's also a good place to grab some Google swag.

 As a fun fact, the Chrome Dino has been considered for an actual LEGO set. It had previously appeared on the LEGO Ideas platform in 2019 and 2023 but failed to gain enough support for production. Now, thanks to this release by Google, you can go ahead and build your own Dino at home.
