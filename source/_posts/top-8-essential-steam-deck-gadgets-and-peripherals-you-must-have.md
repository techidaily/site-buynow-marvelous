 The Steam Deck is a robust piece of hardware as it is, but with the right accessories, you can turn it into the handheld of your dreams. I've compiled a list of some of the best must-have Steam Deck add-ons that will make your handheld gaming experience even better.

## 1  Wireless Bluetooth Controllers 

 It may be handheld by nature, but the Steam Deck supports wireless controllers via Bluetooth to provide you with plenty of alternative control options. Wireless controllers are mostly useful when paired with a dock to simulate a home console experience, and you can even connect several to play local multiplayer.

 While almost any Bluetooth-enabled controller will work just fine, I prefer the [PlayStation 5 DualSense](https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense%C2%AE-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-5/dp/B0CQKL4YTB/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), which goes for about $70, since it feels familiar and has extra features. However, if you want something more affordable, the [8Bitdo Ultimate Wireless controller](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Windows-PC-Raspberry/dp/B0C2V6JLNJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is a great alternative, offering a familiar button layout and even a pricier version that comes with a charging dock.

![ps5 controller](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ps5-controller.png) 

#####  Sony DualSense Controller

Offering haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, and ergonomic design, the DualSense Controller is the best PS5 controller available today.

[$71 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) 

 If you enjoy retro gaming on your Steam Deck, then you might consider the [8Bitdo SN30 Pro Bluetooth](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Switch-Raspberry-Nintendo/dp/B0D2NW7K42/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) controller. It comes in a variety of colors and has a layout similar to a Super Nintendo controller, which can make for a more authentic experience when playing older games.

![8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller Tag](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8bitdo-sn30-pro-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tag.png) 

#####  8Bitdo SN30 Pro Controller

$45 $60 Save $15 

Enhance your gaming experience with the 8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller. This versatile and ergonomic controller seamlessly connects to your favorite devices, delivering precise controls and retro-inspired design. 

[$45 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Joysticks-Vibration-Compatible-Mac/dp/B0BW3T9YBP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) [$45 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/8BitDo-SN30-Pro-Wireless-Bluetooth-Controller-Joysticks-Rumble-Vibration-USB-C-Cable-Gamepad-Compatible-Switch-Windows-Mac-OS-Android-Steam-Green/3819740910)

## 2  Docking Station 

 As I mentioned previously, a wireless controller is much more practical when combined with a docking station to play on your TV or monitor. While [Valve sells an official one on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock)for $80, third-party alternatives are cheaper and often work just as well.

 I use the[6-in-1 docking station from Zyerch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRKTG9WZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), which goes for about $30 and offers a similar level of quality, with the same number of ports for a fraction of the price. It can charge your Deck and display it on your screen while you play with a Bluetooth controller. It even has built-in LEDs for better visibility.

## 3  Portable Keyboard and Mouse 

 Considering the Steam Deck is effectively a portable PC, it has a few drawbacks when it comes to Desktop Mode, which relies on touch-screen inputs. Luckily, [you can connect a keyboard and mouse to use it more like a traditional PC](https://driver-error.techidaily.com/unleashing-potential-in-windows-10-with-lenovo/), especially when combined with a dock.

![A Steam Deck with a low-profile keyboard in front of it.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/here-s-how-to-pick-a-keyboard-for-your-steam-deck.jpg) 

Goran Damnjanovic / How-To Geek

 Many portable keyboards come with a built-in trackpad similar to that of a laptop, such as the [Fosmon Mini Bluetooth Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Fosmon-Portable-Lightweight-Bluetooth-Controller/dp/B00BX0YKX4/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), which goes for about $30\. However, if you're willing to fork over $60 instead, the [ProtoArc foldable set](https://www.amazon.com/Foldable-ProtoArc-Bluetooth-Rechargeable-Full-Size/dp/B0BTNMVJ43/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) includes a physical mouse and keyboard in one package, is easily portable, and works on any Bluetooth-compatible device.

## 4  USB-C Flash Drive 

 There are many reasons why you might want to [move files to and from your Steam Deck](https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-insights-from-experts-unveiling-the-benefits-of-using-the-fitbit-charge-6-user-testimonials-and-opinions/), and doing so is much easier with a physical flash drive. [The SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EZ0X23W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) comes in multiple different capacities ranging from 16 to 256 gigabytes and offers both USB-A and USB-C connectors, making it easy to swap it between your Deck and a larger PC.

![The Sandisk Ultra Dual Drive.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/untitled-design-28.jpg) 

[SanDisk](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EZ0X23W?ref=ppx%5Fyo2ov%5Fdt%5Fb%5Fproduct%5Fdetails&th=1)

 If you already own a USB-C flash drive but lack the means to use it on your PC, you may want to look into an adapter that will let you insert it into a USB-A port as well. Make sure that any adapters you buy support at least USB 3.0 speeds, or you'll be stuck waiting forever for files to transfer.

## 5  Protective Gear 

 You will want to [protect your Steam Deck from potential harm](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-video-privacy-measures-blurring-and-concealing-details-for-2024/)from drops, smudges, scratches, or other types of damage. The obvious first step is to put it in a protective case, such as [the ModCase from JSAUX](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-PC0104-Detachable-Accessories-Protective/dp/B0BRXHK2QL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), which is made of metal and has a detachable front shell, a kickstand and a strap for holding it more securely.

![JSAUX tag](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jsaux-tag.png) 

#####  JSAUX ModCase for Steam Deck

$30 $34 Save $4 

The JSAUD ModCase for Steam Deck offers 360-degree protection for your handheld and features an adjustable kickstand and accessory band for convenient gameplay anytime and anywhere.

[$30 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-PC0104-Detachable-Accessories-Protective/dp/B0BRXHK2QL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) 

 A cheaper and more customizable alternative is a silicone casing such as [this protective case from Suihuoji](https://www.amazon.com/SUIHUOJI-Protective-Thickening-Accessories-Protection/dp/B0B5XHXGLD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) that comes in three colors and includes a set of swappable thumb grips to keep your joysticks pristine.

 Thumb covers are another important thing to have, as they can prevent the rubber from wearing off on your joysticks. Many silicone cases come with a set of them included, but [this set from Skull & Co.](https://www.amazon.com/Skull-Co-Thumb-Joystick-Analog/dp/B0BN3YCS9P/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) comes in multiple colors and includes a pair of raised grips that can enhance certain games.

 A screen protector was one of the first things I ever bought for my Steam Deck since I didn't want to risk scratching or gouging my screen from a mishap. Fortunately, [this 2-pack of tempered glass screen shields from JSAUX](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Protector-Hardness-Resistant-Tempered/dp/B0B55ZD4HL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) not only does the job but comes packed in with a plastic guide to aid with installation.

 Make sure you buy the right size of screen protector or case for your Steam Deck according to your model, as the OLED and LCD models have slightly different screen sizes.

## 6  Compatible MicroSD Card 

 The Steam Deck supports expanded storage devices, specifically via external MicroSD cards that can increase storage space and give you much more room for games. I use the [SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB A1 MicroSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJMRW771/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), which more than doubled my storage space for about $100 at the slight cost of higher load times for certain games.

![SanDisk 1.5TB microSDXC Ultra card.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/screenshot-2024-03-26-at-11-08-03-am.jpg)

#####  SanDisk 1.5TB Ultra microSDXC Card

$110 $150 Save $40 

Need more storage for your tech gadgets or home security cameras? If so, consider getting one of the biggest MicroSD cards on the market, the SanDisk 1.5TB Ultra MicroSDXC card. 

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJMRW771?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) 

 A2 MicroSDs often come recommended for the Steam Deck due to their faster load times and fortunately, they can be found for fairly cheap. [The Silicon Power 1TB A2 MicroSD](https://www.amazon.com/Silicon-Power-Superior-MicroSD-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CF1GPJ83/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) sells for under $100 and will maximize load times with only a slight hit to storage capacity.

## 7  Portable Power Bank 

 The Steam Deck's battery life can be a little inconsistent, especially depending on the model, so a portable power bank is a great way to keep playing when you don't have access to a wall socket. [The Antank Magnetic Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/Antank-Magnetic-Compatible-16000mAh-Detechable/dp/B0BNQFMQP5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) not only offers fast, portable charging for the Steam Deck, but it also has a detachable back mount that lets you attach it to the back of your Deck for easy portability.

[The Baseus Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Charger-Charging-20000mAh/dp/B09N3PRJZK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) comes in at nearly twice the price, going for about $100, but it has a higher wattage, which means faster charging. It also includes an LCD to show the current battery percentage.

#####  Baseus 100W Laptop Power Bank

7/ 10 

Featuring two PD USB-C ports and certified for PD 3.0 and PPS with a power output going up to 100W, the power bank allows you to fast charge your MacBook Pro 16-inch up to 36% in only 30 minutes.

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Charger-Charging-20000mAh/dp/B09N3PRJZK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) [See at baseus](https://www.baseus.com/products/blade-laptop-power-bank-100w-20000mah)

## 8  A More Expansive Carrying Case 

 The carrying case packed in with the Steam Deck works fine, but it lacks room for storing the charging cord and any other add-ons you might buy. [JSAUX makes a great alternative](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Carrying-Compatible-Protective-Accessories/dp/B0BRK96DJX/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), with its own compact case that has compartments for MicroSD cards, charging cables and even a docking station so you can fit everything in a single case.

 For something a little more stylish, you could also check out the [Tomtoc Carrying Bag](https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Accessories-Protective-Lightweight-nintendo-wii/dp/B09ZYFV1GD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004375&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsteam-deck-accessories-i-wouldnt-go-without%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), which has dedicated pockets for the Deck itself along with room for many of its essentials. It can sling over your shoulder like a duffle bag and is also a bit more discrete, which can be reassuring if you're worried about it being stolen.

---

 Valve's official offerings are generally high-quality, but they can also be expensive, and third-party options often work just as well for a fraction of the cost. As long as you know where to look, when it comes to customizing your Steam Deck experience, there is no reason to settle for the bare minimum.

 While you wait for your new accessories to come in, check out how [the Steam Deck has helped me get through some of the oldest games on my backlog](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-about-poco-m6-pro-4g-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/) or [why handheld gaming might be preferable to playing on a traditional PC](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-utilizing-internal-screen-recording-on-huaweis-mate-1020-and-p-models-p20-p10/).
